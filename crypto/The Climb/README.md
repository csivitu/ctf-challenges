## Description

This is a crypto challenge to reverse the Hill Cipher program.

## Requirements

- Java

## Sources

"We are not lost, we're right here somewhere on this little blue line. Wait, why do I feel like I'm being watched?"
(Don't forget to wrap the flag with csictf{})

```

## Exploit

You just need to write a program to reverse the Hill Cipher, key element being inverting the ciphertext matrix.

Solution program:
- [The Climb solution](./theclimbsol.java)

The flag is:

```
csictf{hillshaveeyes}
```
