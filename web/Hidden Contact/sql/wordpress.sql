href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">Global WordPress Translation Day</a>, a 24-hour, round-the-clock, digital and physical global marathon dedicated to the localisation and internationalisation of the WordPress platform and ecosystem, a structure that powers, today, over 28% of all existing websites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The localisation process allows for WordPress and for all WordPress-related products (themes and plugins) to be available in local languages, so to improve their accessibility and usage and to allow as many people as possible to take advantage of the free platform and services available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a (not completely) serendipitous coincidence, September 30 has also been declared by the United Nations “International Translation Day”, to pay homage to the great services of translators everywhere, one that allows communication and exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The event will feature a series of multi-language live speeches (training sessions, tutorials, case histories, etc.) that will be screen-casted in streaming, starting from Australia and the Far East and ending in the Western parts of the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In that same 24-hour time frame, Polyglots worldwide will gather physically in local events, for dedicated training and translations sprints (and for some fun and socializing as well), while those unable to physically join their teams will do so remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A big, fun, useful and enlightening party and a lovely mix of growing, giving, learning and teaching, to empower, and cultivate, and shine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here are some stats about the first two events:</span></p>\n<p><b>Global WordPress Translation Day 1</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">   </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">448 translators

This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/\">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/\">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/\">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/\">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy\">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/\">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/\">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">for testing</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/\">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/\">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/\">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/\">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/\">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/\">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href=\"https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac\">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/\">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">submit it here</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></i></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"4899\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"WordPress 4.8.1 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/wordpress-4-8-1-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 21:26:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4875\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:366:\"After over 13 million downloads of WordPress 4.8, we are pleased to announce the immediate availability of WordPress 4.8.1, a maintenance release.

Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/\">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/\">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress core’s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule\">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. It’s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably — since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program. This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.</p>\n<p>You can find a local meetup group to join <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">on meetup.com</a>, and if you would like to get involved in organizing events for your community, you can find out more about the inner workings of the program <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/\">on the Community Team site</a> or by joining the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.1 due for imminent release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 cycle’s first maintenance release will be published in the coming week, more than a month after 4.8 was released. This release fix some important issues in WordPress core and the majority of users will find that their sites will update to this new version automatically.</p>\n<p>If you would like to help out by testing this release before it goes live, you can follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/\">beta testing guide</a> for WordPress core.

For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\">the announcement post</a>.

The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/\">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/\">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href=\"https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/\">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/\">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/\">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/\">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/\">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/\">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/\">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/\">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href=\"https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/\">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/\">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>. You can also visit <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\">the project’s GitHub repository</a> to report issues and contribute to the codebase.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bridget Willard <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/21/proposed-wordcamp-editorial-calendar/\">has proposed an editorial calendar</a> to assist WordCamp organizers with publishing content for their event.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">A new kind of niche WordCamp, <a href=\"https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp for Publishers in Denver</a>, has opened ticket sales.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">The WordPress iOS app was updated with <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/an-all-new-media-library-for-the-wordpress-ios-app/\">a fresh, new media library</a> this month.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">It looks like <i>Underscores</i>, the popular WordPress starter theme, <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2017/06/26/the-future-of-underscores-and-a-new-committer/\">has a bright future ahead of it</a>, with a renewed vision and new committer.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">The always-inspiring Tom McFarlin <a href=\"https://tommcfarlin.com/simple-autoloader-for-wordpress\">has released a simple autoloader for WordPress</a> that looks very useful indeed.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">After a bit of a discussion on Twitter regarding the differences between WordPress.org, WordPress.com, and Jetpack, <a href=\"https://helen.wordpress.com/2017/06/21/restaurant-vs-meal-kit-vs-grocery-shopping-or-wordpress-com-vs-jetpack-vs-wordpress-org/\">Helen Hou-Sandí came up with a great analogy</a> and an interesting post about it all.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you’re interested in contributing specifically to the JavaScript or PHP areas of the WordPress core codebase, then the new #core-js and #core-php channels in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> are perfect for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please </i><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\"><i>submit it here</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"4865\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"WordPress 4.8 “Evans”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:49:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4770\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:373:\"An Update with You in Mind Gear up for a more intuitive WordPress!

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1\" class=\"video-player\"><video id=\"v-8BDWH3QG-1-video\" width=\"632\" height=\"342\" poster=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg\" controls=\"true\" preload=\"metadata\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" /><source src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv\" type=\"video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;\" /><div><img alt=\"Link Boundaries\" src=\"https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?w=1126&amp;ssl=1 1126w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world?

These panel headings improve the experience for people using assistive technologies.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/removal-of-core-embedding-support-for-wmv-and-wma-file-formats/\">Removal of Core Support for WMV and WMA Files</a></h3>\n<p>As fewer and fewer browsers support Silverlight, file formats which require the presence of the Silverlight plugin are being removed from core support. Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/\">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/\">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/\">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href=\"https://matt.blog\">Matt</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17\">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

Bolinger recently attended a Content and Commerce Summit where WordPress and WooCommerce were not mentioned. Bolinger <a href=\"http://scottbolinger.com/perspective-on-wordpress/\">shared the perspective</a> he gained from an attending the event and speaking with a friend who uses Shopify.</p>\n<p>We discuss what happened to WordPress&#8217; ease of use, which user segment the project is developed for, and how can it provide an end-to-end user experience that&#8217;s on par with SaaS offerings like SquareSpace or Wix. We also talk about the challenges associated with setting up a WordPress site after the installation process.

Users can connect their Google accounts to have access to their photos when inserting an image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-3.39.22-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/photos/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google Photos</a> has gained popularity due to its automatic tagless organization and free, unlimited backup for photos and videos up to 16MP and 1080p HD. In May 2017, the service reported <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-500-million-new-sharing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">500 million monthly users</a> backing up more than 1.2 billion photos and videos per day.</p>\n<p>When inserting pictures on WordPress.com, users can also take advantage of Google&#8217;s smart image searching capabilities. The service is fairly good at recognizing what is in your images and where they were taken, even if you haven&#8217;t specifically categorized them or added descriptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-3.46.51-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The new Google Photos integration is also available for Jetpack-enabled sites when posting via the WordPress.com interface. (It is not available in wp-admin of self-hosted sites.) Unfortunately, this experience is still rather buggy. After adding photos, WordPress.com didn&#8217;t seem to be able to save drafts and it was also unable to display the most recent photos from the past week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-1.44.52-PM-e1506544898526.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Users should also note that when you authenticate with Google Photos, it will open access to the photos from every single site that you have connected to that particular WordPress.com account. This access is, however, is limited to the specific user who connected. Multiple users on a site will each need to authenticate separately and can connect their own Google accounts. The users do not have access to each other&#8217;s photos. It&#8217;s also easy to revoke access at <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/sharing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wordpress.com/sharing</a>.</p>\n<p>The new Google Photos feature has been very well received by WordPress.com users, as it saves them the trouble of downloading images from the service and then uploading to their media libraries. It&#8217;s not quite as convenient for Jetpack-enabled sites, because it adds additional steps to the publishing process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Excellent feature, but will it be available directly from self-hosted sites without using WordPress.com?&#8221; one user asked. &#8220;This cuts out so many steps in our publishing workflow, but then adds several more if we then need to login to WordPress.com to do this. Our admin setup is complex, so switching to editing here isn’t an option. I have multiple contributors who write directly and this would be a game changer if they could directly upload their images from their account.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A WordPress.com representative confirmed that there are currently no plans to support a standalone version in Jetpack. They are, however, looking at supporting other services, such as Flickr, in the future.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 22:17:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: Camp Press – A Detox from Digital Life\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75139\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://wptavern.com/camp-press-a-detox-from-digital-life\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3381:\"<p>The following is a guest post by Brad Williams who shares his experience at <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">Camp Press</a> this past weekend. Brad is the Co-Founder and CEO of the website design and development agency <a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com\">WebDevStudios</a>.</p>\n<p>He is also a co-author of the Professional WordPress book series. Brad is a US Marine Corps veteran and has been developing websites for over 20 years, including the last 10 where he has focused on open-source technologies like WordPress.</p>\n<hr />\n<img />Brad Williams at Camp Press\n<p>I’ve been to a number of WordCamps and tech-related events over the years. They all follow a similar pattern of speakers, panels, sponsors, after-parties, etc. We’ve all been to these types of events and generally know what to expect; so when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ifyouwillit?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Mendel Kurland</a> pitched the idea of <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">Camp Press</a> to me as &#8216;geeks camping,&#8217; I was intrigued.</p>\n<p>I went to Camp Press with no idea of what to expect. I honestly have never felt less prepared for an event as I did for this one. I like to plan. So, going to an event where I wasn’t 100% sure how it would work had me feeling nervous. What I soon realized is that I liked being pushed out of my &#8216;safety bubble.&#8217;</p>\n<p>The Camp Press location was absolutely amazing and truly helped make the event special. We stayed at a large summer camp style setup, about an hour outside of Oklahoma City called Fry Lake. If you aren’t familiar with Oklahoma, just imagine driving an hour from a large city to the middle of nowhere. Perfect.</p>\n<p>Fry Lake had cabins, shower and bathroom facilities, an amazing swimming lake with diving boards, and a full cafeteria kitchen. We were literally back at the type of summer camp we experienced as kids, and we immediately knew it.</p>\n<img />Camp Press Fire\n<p>As we learned more about each other, we quickly became more comfortable as a group. We shared stories, laughed, cooked, and debated topics from tech to TV shows. We discussed very personal struggles and experiences, some of which I would guess haven’t been shared outside of close family. We sang songs around the campfire, performed late-night improv, made s’mores, and enjoyed each other’s company.</p>\n<p>Even more amazing is that nothing was scripted. There was no agenda, set activities, presentations. It was just natural interaction. Over the course of a few days, we all grew closer to each other. There was an unspoken bond forming between everyone at Camp Press.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know what to expect going to <a href=\"https://camp.press/\">Camp Press</a>. What I promptly learned is that was the entire point of the event—doing the unexpected, pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone, making new friends, having fun and serious conversations, and doing all of this without the normal technology that is always around us.</p>\n<p>When is the last time you had a detox from digital life? My detox was last weekend, and I can’t wait to do it again!</p>\n<img />Camp Press Attendees\n<p>For more insight into Camp Press and to get Mendel&#8217;s perspective, check out the event&#8217;s <a

September 30 2017, the WordPress Polyglots Team &#8211; whose mission is to translate WordPress into as many languages as possible &#8211; will hold its third <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">Global WordPress Translation Day</a>, a 24-hour, round-the-clock, digital and physical global marathon dedicated to the localisation and internationalisation of the WordPress platform and ecosystem, a structure that powers, today, over 28% of all existing websites.</span></p>\n<p><span>The localisation process allows for WordPress and for all WordPress-related products (themes and plugins) to be available in local languages, so to improve their accessibility and usage and to allow as many people as possible to take advantage of the free platform and services available.</span></p>\n<p><span>In a (not completely) serendipitous coincidence, September 30 has also been declared by the United Nations “International Translation Day”, to pay homage to the great services of translators everywhere, one that allows communication and exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span>The event will feature a series of multi-language live speeches (training sessions, tutorials, case histories, etc.) that will be screen-casted in streaming, starting from Australia and the Far East and ending in the Western parts of the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span>In that same 24-hour time frame, Polyglots worldwide will gather physically in local events, for dedicated training and translations sprints (and for some fun and socializing as well), while those unable to physically join their teams will do so remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span>A big, fun, useful and enlightening party and a lovely mix of growing, giving, learning and teaching, to empower, and cultivate, and shine.</span></p>\n<p><span>Here are some stats about the first two events:</span></p>\n<p><b>Global WordPress Translation Day 1</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>   </span><span>448 translators worldwide</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>50 local events worldwide</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>54 locales involved</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>40350 strings translated, in</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>597 projects</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Global WordPress Translation Day 2</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>   </span><span>780 translators worldwide</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>67 local events worldwide</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>133 locales involved</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>60426 strings translated, in</span></li>\n<li><span>   </span><span>590 projects</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>We would like your help in spreading this news and in reaching out to all four corners of the world to make the third #WPTranslationDay a truly amazing one and to help celebrate the unique and fundamental role that translators have in the Community but also in all aspects of life.</span></p>\n<p><span>A full press release is available, along with more information and visual assets at </span><a

could never have imagined that WordPress would become an important part of my life.\" /><p>I grew up in a suburb to Stockholm, where me and my brothers would wrestle over who was allowed to use our first PC. I think it was a pre-owned old beaten Compaq Deskpro 386. We only stopped arguing once we could sit down together and play Civ; one of us at the controls, the others giving advice on what moves to make.</p>\n<h3>Dipping Into The Web</h3>\n<p>I learnt HTML and built my first pages on Geocities and out of necessity: I needed a place to publish my angsty teenage poetry. But people didn’t come to my website for the bad poetry, instead they filled my guestbook with webdesign and HTML questions.</p>\n<p>I have built websites for myself and others since the mid 90’s and kept a few clients on the side while studying. At this time, there was not a lot of computer or programming classes available for high school students. It had been easy enough to learn HTML online by reading guides, message boards and similar. During one of my final semesters, my school announced a new class called “Computers for girls”. I signed up hoping to learn enough to assemble or upgrade my own PC. The class was a joke. Instead of teaching us about motherboards, memory or networks, our teacher showed us where to put the cords…</p>\n<p>He didn’t realise that most of us already spent every recess in the computer halls, chatting over IRC. In order to learn the basics of actual programming (not just HTML), I had to take adult education evening- and summer classes since my school didn’t offer any.</p>\n<h3>Derailed</h3>\n<p>After high school I did like many others of my generation: I fell in love with someone I had only met online, who lived on the other side of the world. All to the soundtrack of Savage Garden&#8217;s “I Knew I Loved You”.</p>\n<div class=\"jetpack-video-wrapper\"></div>\n<p>It took all my savings and courage to travel back and forward between Sweden and the US, while studying from a distance.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When my boyfriend suddenly passed away in 2001 I had to make drastic changes in my life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was in the middle of moving, I couldn’t keep up with deadlines or deal with clients, and I was barely able to finish my project managing and programming classes. I had to forget all our plans, start over, and take a desk job instead.</p>\n<h3>Coming Back To The Web</h3>\n<p>Many years later one of my former clients asked if I had tried WordPress. It took me a few months to decide if I liked it or not, partially because I didn’t know PHP, and because I didn’t have great experiences from trying Joomla and Drupal.</p>\n<p>I did some customization work and eventually I submitted my first theme to WordPress.org. Of course my theme was a mess and did not even work as expected.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I appreciated that someone took the time to look at my code and explain what I needed to do to fix it and where I could read more. It was very rare to receive such feedback.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I joined the Theme Review Team&#8217;s mailing list, listening in and learning. I started reviewing themes to learn more and to improve my own themes.</p>\n<p>For those who do not know what the Theme Review Team does, we test and review the code (every single file) of themes that are submitted to be included in the WordPress.org theme directory.</p>\n<h3>My Secret Power</h3>\n<p>Because I am on the autism spectrum, the structure and patterns of coding languages suits me well. I need both structure and a creative outlet in my life, and coding is therapy, much like a puzzle or a coloring book. I love my once dreaded desk job, because it gives me the opportunity to help people on a different scale than I ever could as a freelancer. Being a volunteer on WordPress.org lets me combine both worlds.</p>\n<p>I could never have imagined that WordPress would become an important part of my life, that I would spend this much time on it (sometimes up to 20 hours per week), or that I would be asked to be one of the team leads for the Theme Review Team in 2017.</p>\n<p>Today I honestly don’t know what I would do if I could no longer contribute to WordPress the way I know and am familiar with. It is an essential part of my everyday life.</p>\n<p>WordPress is also challenging because you can only do so much without interacting with others… And even though I find that difficult, I have had to learn that it is something I need as well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have to remind myself from time to time that here, I am allowed to be myself, with all my flaws, to contribute as much or as little as I choose, at my own pace.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And to be able to contribute and to help others, I also have to remind myself that people are not scary.</p>\n<h3>And Then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>I was a volunteer online for 6 years before I had the courage to go to my first WordCamp, which took place in my own home town. When I was finally there, I only spoke to 3 or 4 people. My second WordCamp went better, but the experience was still overwhelming.</p>\n<p>During my third WordCamp, which was WCEU 2017, I helped lead the Theme Review section of the contributor day, having to speak in front of 500 people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The thing is, even when it overwhelms you, this community and its energy is addicting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Everything changes once you go to your first meetup or WordCamp, meeting people who share your interest and passion. The community at large is open and welcoming, passionate, curious and caring. And it is trying to be a safe place for us all.</p>\n<h3>The Theme Review Team</h3>\n<p>There always seem to be a lot of opinions and even controversy surrounding the Theme Review Team. It is not always easy to handle the pressure and the amount of responsibility that is placed on you because so many people have a financial interest in WordPress themes. As a team lead or moderator, you often have to try to find the least bad solution to many different kind of situations.</p>\n<p>By the end of September, it is time for the current team leads to step back and welcome our next leads. I am looking forward to the break, but also to see what new ideas they will bring.<br />\nIt takes time to change a system that has been in place for this many years, and truthfully, sometimes it is painfully slow. It has proven difficult to find a system where themes without errors can be added to the directory quickly, and where reviewers can support authors who need extra help.</p>\n<p>This amazing team of volunteers has managed to reduce the queue time from 7 months down to 8-10 weeks. We still hope to be able to reduce it further, possibly by automating parts of the code review.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Theme Review Team is open to everyone and always looking for new volunteers.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Challenge Gladly Accepted\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Challenge%20Gladly%20Accepted&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchallenge-gladly-accepted%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Challenge Gladly Accepted\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchallenge-gladly-accepted%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fchallenge-gladly-accepted%2F&title=Challenge+Gladly+Accepted\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Challenge Gladly Accepted\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/challenge-gladly-accepted/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/092717-150x150.jpg&description=Challenge Gladly Accepted\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Challenge Gladly Accepted\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/challenge-gladly-accepted/\" title=\"Challenge Gladly Accepted\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/challenge-gladly-accepted/\">Challenge Gladly Accepted</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 00:00:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Carolina Nymark\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:122:\"WPTavern: WordPress Core JavaScript Framework Selection Discussion Continues with Input from Open Source Community Leaders\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75086\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:133:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-javascript-framework-selection-discussion-continues-with-input-from-open-source-community-leaders\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10632:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/javascript.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; #core-js Slack channel hosted a lively and productive meeting this morning led by Andrew Duthie. The discussion focused less on specific framework comparisons and more on the role a framework will play in building JavaScript-powered interfaces for WordPress. Contributors were joined by core developers and leaders from the React and Vue communities, Chrome engineers, and other interested parties from outside the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This chat will focus largely on identifying requirements in building core features, overlap with plugin and theme authors, and patterns to reducing framework lock-in,&#8221; Duthie said. &#8220;Ideally this is higher-level than simply debating the merits of specific frameworks in a vacuum, and should be seen as an opportunity to collaborate between projects to set a path forward for WordPress which will provide flexibility and resiliency to future churn.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Duthie began by asking what role a framework should play in a WordPress developer&#8217;s workflow and also asked framework contributors to offer their perspectives on recommendations for extendable interfaces. This question provided attendees with the opportunity to weigh in on topics such as <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2791\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">support for web components</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">framework-agnostic block interoperability</a> for Gutenberg, and how this might affect WordPress&#8217; plugin ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I disagree a bit with the idea that whatever core (in this case Gutenberg) uses to power some of the intricacies of building a stateful app is going to be the de facto standard for plugin development,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Matías Ventura said. &#8220;The actual framework here, in general terms, is going to be what WordPress exposes and the APIs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks, the library that core decides to build on doesn&#8217;t have to become the de facto standard for plugin developers but many outside the Gutenberg team believe that it will inevitably end up that way in practice. There are entire teams of engineers waiting on this decision that are committed to adopt whichever framework WordPress bets on.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To provide some perspective on how WP’s decision on a framework impacts developers downstream, I’m a developer at Boston University and our plan is to focus on whichever framework WP decides upon, even if Gutenberg has a completely agnostic API,&#8221; Adam Pieniazek said. &#8220;We’re primarily a WP shop (~ 1,000 site WP install powers most/a lot of our public web presence) and end up creating huge customizations on top of WP that often require diving into core to see what is actually happening in the background. I like Vue more than React personally, but if WP decides upon React, BU will focus on building expertise in React for when we need to peek/debug beyond the API. It doesn’t mean we won’t also use Vue but it won’t be our primary focus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pieniazek feedback echoes that of Gravity Forms co-founder Carl Hancock, who said his team is ready to adopt whatever library WordPress selects.</p>\n<p>“People are going to end up adopting whatever core uses for the most part despite the rainbows and butterflies some are claiming as it relates to creating an abstraction layer so plugin/theme developers can use whatever they want,” Hancock said in the #core-js channel earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Many participants from outside the WordPress community seemed to be in agreement with a framework-agnostic approach and none were eager to force a single framework on all developers working with WordPress. The remaining concern is how this works out practically and whether it puts developers in the confusing position of using a framework on top of a framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since Gutenberg itself is going to become a platform to build for, the best level of separation is if the framework is used to build the core, but isn’t exposed as API to block builders,&#8221; AMP engineer Paul Bakaus said. &#8220;This gives one the choice to replace the underlying foundation whenever necessary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella summarized the approach the team has been discussing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think what we try to communicate is something like:</p>\n<p>&#8211; WordPress Core is going to use this X framework internally<br />\n &#8211; If you want to use it, we think it’s good<br />\n &#8211; If you want to use something else, you can just as easily as you’d use the Core’s chosen framework</p></blockquote>\n<p>Benguella also said that one of the goals for Gutenberg is &#8220;to set the basis for how we extend WordPress&#8217; UI in the future.&#8221; Once it ships, the team will likely set its sights on other parts of the wp-admin and build them in the same way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If all parts of WP’s UI can be extended via a standard interface, whether it be a simple &#8216;data down, events up&#8217; API, or expecting a WC, I think this would cleanly separate the concerns of &#8216;what framework to use for core&#8217; vs. &#8216;what framework to use for extension development,\'&#8221; Vue.js creator Evan You said.</p>\n<p>When asked for his thoughts on on React becoming a primary framework for WordPress, React maintainer Dan Abromov was hesitant to advocate for WordPress adopting the library. His response underscored the necessity of having a framework-agnostic approach for extending Gutenberg and future WP interface overhauls.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know WordPress well, so it&#8217;s hard for me to say whether it&#8217;s a great fit for the use case or not,&#8221; Abramov said. &#8220;Generally we use React for highly interactive UIs and find that it scales well with the app size. I&#8217;m also happy to answer technical questions about it. But I think in general people have strong opinions about, for example, templating vs expressiveness, and I don&#8217;t feel like forcing React upon everyone is the best way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I also feel the same way,&#8221; Evan You said. &#8220;Forcing a single framework on everyone, regardless of which one, is IMO not a good idea because it is bound to alienate the group of devs who are not into that framework, and imposes a bigger long term stability risk.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Abramov also said that people are already &#8220;very bitter and divisive&#8221; about the subject of selecting a framework. He also tweeted a similar sentiment prior to the meeting.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When I read discussion threads (e.g. about WordPress) there’s a sense that people perceive every team as hostile to others.

It’s just a matter of proper implementation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants referenced <a href=\"https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">custom-elements-everywhere.com</a>, a site that displays popular JS frameworks&#8217; progress on communicating Custom Elements in a way that promotes interoperability. Matías Ventura asked React and Vue core devs how web components (and their future) fit into each framework at the moment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In React, we have some web component support but haven&#8217;t made it a large priority since use cases have seemed slim in the past, especially since adding Web Components hasn&#8217;t made a lot of sense in a first-party application where you control the whole stack – but we do have some support for them nonetheless and I&#8217;m happy to entertain adding more, either now or in the future,&#8221; Sophie Alpert said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the high level I think frameworks like React/Vue provide what is not really addressed in web components: efficient and declarative DOM updates reacting to state changes,&#8221; Evan You said. &#8220;This is also why Polymer exists on top of WC. I have always acknowledged the value of WC as an interop interface.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Overall, attendees at the meeting were respectful, collaborative, and eager to contribute their expertise to help WordPress contributors find the best way forward in the framework selection process. The discussion will continue at next week&#8217;s meeting and likely in the comments of a forthcoming Make/Core post summarizing the meeting.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 22:16:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Spam Code\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75059\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://wptavern.com/si-captcha-anti-spam-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-og-due-to-spam-code\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4092:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam</a> plugin has been removed from the WordPress Directory due to its author including spam code. The plugin added a CAPTCHA image test to WordPress forms to prevent spam and was compatible with forms generated by bbPress, BuddyPress, Jetpack, and WooCommerce. It had more than 300,000 active installs at the time of removal.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikechallis\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Challis</a>, the original author of the plugin, said that a WordPress.org user named &#8220;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/fastsecure\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fastsecure</a>&#8221; became the new owner of SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam in June 2017. Challis was not aware of the new owner&#8217;s plans for the plugin but <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-did-the-plugin-go-2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">posted a notice</a> on the WordPress.org support forums to inform users about why it was removed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new owner attempted to put code in several of his newly acquired WordPress plugins that would connect to a 3rd party server he also owned and place spam ads for payday loans and such in the WP posts,&#8221; Challis said. He also linked the incident to a ring of WordPress plugins that researchers at Wordfence say were part of a <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/09/coordinated-plugin-spam/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">coordinated spam campaign</a>. Display Widgets, one of the most notable plugins in this group, was recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">permanently removed from WordPress.org</a> for a series of violations wherein the author had injected malicious code.</p>\n<p>Challis said the new owner failed to display any spam on sites due to how the code was implemented, but the code could have been activated at a later time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The new owner put spam code in versions 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 but it failed to display any spam because he put the code in the secureimage.php file. The malicious code required WordPress libraries to also be loaded to execute. The reason the spam code did not do anything at all is because the secureimage.php file is not included in the WordPress run time environment. The secureimage.php file is included from another file securimage_show.php that loads the captcha image directly from html img src outside of the WordPress run time. The spam code in this plugin was never activated, it would not have corrupted your posts or changed anything in the WordPress database.</p></blockquote>\n<p>SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam users who still have the plugin installed may see an update available in the WordPress admin. Plugin team member Samuel (Otto) Wood removed the malicious code and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-did-the-plugin-go-2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released 3.0.3</a> as a clean version that is a safe update for users who still rely on the plugin. Wood recommends users find an alternative, because SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam will not be re-listed in the directory or receive any future updates.</p>\n<p>The incident is another reminder for users to be on alert when WordPress.org plugins change hands, as the buyers do not always disclose their actual intentions for the plugin.

In a surprising move, Matt Mullenweg announced that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress would also be parting ways with React</a> and planned to remove it from the upcoming Gutenberg editor.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s decision to drop React from consideration for WordPress was likely an influential factor in Facebook&#8217;s eventual about-face on the topic of re-licensing the project. Facebook&#8217;s announcement on Friday acknowledges that the company failed to convince the open source community of the benefits of its BSD + Patents license:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re relicensing these projects because React is the foundation of a broad ecosystem of open source software for the web, and we don&#8217;t want to hold back forward progress for nontechnical reasons. </p>\n<p>This decision comes after several weeks of disappointment and uncertainty for our community. Although we still believe our BSD + Patents license provides some benefits to users of our projects, we acknowledge that we failed to decisively convince this community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The React 16 release, slated for this week, will ship with the updated MIT license. Facebook declined to respond to our request for further comment and said their post is the only public statement they will be providing.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear whether WordPress will continue on with React, picking up where the team left off on Gutenberg, or  shift to another library. Core contributors had originally <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nacin/status/911356481936740352\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decided on React</a> while attending WordPress&#8217; community summit in Paris last June, although this decision had not yet been made public when the greater open source community started petitioning Facebook to re-license React.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m just so tired of this drama,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella said. &#8220;We spent days and days thinking about the best framework for WP, and this change will just add more thinking, complexity, and uncertainty to our decision. I’m just tired of all this&#8230;we all have to rethink everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg, who had previously penned a several-thousand word unpublished announcement about how WordPress would be adopting React, did not confirm whether WordPress is still examining other libraries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our decision to move away from React, based on their previous stance, has sparked a lot of interesting discussions in the WordPress world,&#8221; Mullenweg said in a <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/facebook-dropping-patent-clause/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> published to his blog this weekend. &#8220;Particularly with Gutenberg there may be an approach that allows developers to write Gutenberg blocks (Gutenblocks) in the library of their choice including Preact, Polymer, or Vue, and now React could be an officially-supported option as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The regularly scheduled core JavaScript meeting is set for Tuesday, September 26 at 15:00 GMT and contributors plan to discuss the role a JS framework will play in current and future core focuses. The time has been changed to be two hours later than originally planned in an effort to accommodate more contributors across various timezones.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 16:53:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"Matt: Facebook Dropping Patent Clause\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47574\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/facebook-dropping-patent-clause/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1326:\"<p>I am surprised and excited to see the news that Facebook is going to drop the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/\">patent clause that I wrote about last week</a>.

I watched a presentation where the presenter had slides with 20+ different recommended tools on them, and not a single mention of WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is an eCommerce conference, WooCommerce is 41% of all eCommerce stores, and not a single person said the word WooCommerce. All I heard about was Shopify and Amazon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.similartech.com/\">SimilarTech</a>, WooCommerce is leading in the top 100K sites, top 1M sites, and the entire web while Shopify is leading in the top 10K sites. While Shopify has a lot less market share, it&#8217;s used on substantially higher trafficked sites.</p>\n<p>Bolinger shared the perspective of a friend who uses Shopify to sell clothing and will gross more than $1M in revenue this year. According to his friend, Shopify is easy to use, from setting up a theme, to the plugin/app ecosystem to add functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When my friend said Shopify is easy to use, this is a whole different category of great user experience,&#8221; Bolinger said. &#8220;This is building a site from scratch for a completely non-technical user, and them loving the end result and the experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bolinger raised an interesting point in that, Wix, Shopify, and SquareSpace are closed, SaaS offerings where they can control the user experience from end-to-end. This is impossible to do with WordPress because there are too many moving parts and core can not control how plugins and themes take part in that experience.</p>\n<p>While WordPress core can&#8217;t necessarily solve the problem, it hasn&#8217;t stopped webhosts from trying. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-new-onboarding-experience-for-wordpress-customers\">GoDaddy</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/blog/bluehost-news/welcome-to-the-new-bluehost-8973/\">Bluehost</a>, and others have created onboarding solutions that try to control the end-to-end user experience.</p>\n<p>Bolinger shared a sentiment that many in the WordPress community have advocated in recent years. &#8220;If we’re honest, the strength of WordPress is not that it’s easy to use for non-technical people. It’s an open-source platform that is easy for developers to extend and customize for clients.&#8221;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mattreport.com/wordpress-is-not-easy/\">WordPress is Not Easy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mor10.com/wordpress-easy-thats-ok/\">WordPress is not easy – and that’s OK</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://neliosoftware.com/blog/is-wordpress-as-easy-as-we-think/\">Is WordPress As Easy As We Think?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There was a time, somewhere between WordPress 2.3 and WordPress 3.5, where one of the main reasons people used WordPress was because it was easy. Between then and now, what caused WordPress to lose its ease-of-use factor?</p>\n<p>SquareSpace, Wix, and Shopify didn&#8217;t exist in the early days of WordPress, they were late to market. This gave them the advantage of implementing all the lessons learned through WordPress&#8217; lifespan and since it&#8217;s a closed system, they can iterate rapidly.</p>\n<p>The biggest reality check that Bolinger shares is that there are a lot of people WordPress simply doesn&#8217;t cater too.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is a large contingent of people who just want to get stuff done, they don’t want to fuss with the tech&#8221;, He said. &#8220;They don’t care about open source or owning their data. They don’t want to install a theme and setup their widgets, or search thousands of results to find the best SEO plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They don’t want to set up &#8216;managed hosting&#8217;, an SSL certificate, or a payment gateway.

One of the more recent topics is the possibility of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">framework-agnostic block rendering</a> for Gutenberg, which would allow developers to extend the new editor using any JS library they prefer. This means that Gutenberg blocks, which are colloquially referred to as &#8220;Gutenblocks,&#8221; could be built with Vue, React, Preact, Angular, or whatever the developer feels comfortable using.</p>\n<p>Proponents of this idea contend that pursuing a more flexible approach makes WordPress&#8217; core JS framework decision <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463#issuecomment-330637007\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">less critical</a>. While answering questions on the #core-js channel, Gary Pendergast explained how Gutenberg could be built to maintain the separation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really not joking when I say that this decision doesn&#8217;t matter, even for people contributing to Gutenberg,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;In <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">#2463</a>, the library is treated entirely as a utility library, much like we use lodash, for example. It performs a handful of tasks, and it can be relatively easily pulled out and replaced with something entirely different, with no disruption to the rest of the codebase. For people contributing to Gutenberg, they&#8217;re contributing in the Gutenberg coding style, not the style of whatever library we happen to import.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked about a timeline for when the decision will be made and what factors are being considered, Pendergast replied that there is no timeline and that those interested in participating should blog about their experiences and write examples of things they can build with the JS frameworks they are familiar with.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is neither roadmap, nor timeline, nor does there need to be,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;As Matt mentioned, it&#8217;s really just a technical decision &#8211; the important decision for the wider community was choosing &#8216;not React.&#8217; Unfortunately, this decision has been blown way out of proportion, and heavily conflated with &#8216;what JS library will I be able to build my plugins with?&#8217; and sometimes &#8216;what JS library&#8217;s practices will Gutenberg blocks resemble?,&#8217; neither of which are related. Tweets and posts that treat it like a horse race are not helpful in this way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast said whatever library is selected will &#8220;continue to be wrapped by the WordPress element, the underlying library won&#8217;t be exposed.&#8221; The Gutenberg team is working to remove all library dependencies from its components so that plugin developers can use any library they choose.</p>\n<p>However, other community members are not so eager to relegate the JS library selected for core to a simple technical decision or utility library.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most developers understand that their plugins are not bound by the framework chosen for core/Gutenberg,&#8221; Kevin Hoffman said. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t diminish the significance of the decision. If we want to encourage more contributors, we&#8217;d be well served to choose a framework in which a significant majority feel capable and confident. If this majority is out there developing plugins with one framework and has to learn another in order to contribute to core, then we&#8217;re limiting the number of potential contributors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Peter Booker contends that no matter how elegant Gutenberg&#8217;s separation is, having a decent understanding of the library chosen for core affects a developers&#8217; ability to deeply troubleshoot certain issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do not think we should be so dismissive of the choice as a minor technical decision,&#8221; Booker said. &#8220;Understanding how PHP, JavaScript, and Backbone (among other things) work is essential to be able to properly debug problems with WordPress. The JS framework chosen for Gutenberg is going to impact a great many people, even if we are not core contributors. It will be essential knowledge to be able to fully troubleshoot issues. This is a decision which will impact far more people than just the Gutenberg team.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What are the implications of providing a flexible, framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks?</h3>\n<p>Jason Bahl asked if anyone has tried mixing React, Preact, Vue, and Angular in a single app to see if it is &#8220;a recipe for a performance nightmare.&#8221; He posed an example scenario wherein Gravity Forms builds Vue-based Gutenblocks, Yoast has React-based blocks, WooCommerce builds blocks with Preact, and another plugin uses Ember.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It sounds kind of nice to be flexible and allow folks to use whatever but also like it could lead to a lot of division on best practices, and potentially performance issues,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see tutorials pop up for how to build Gutenblocks in Vue, React, Preact, Ember, Vanilla JS, etc., which would be cool to see, but also confusing and potentially cause further divide in the community and accepted best practices. Flexibility is nice to a degree, but a strong opinion at some level is also good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Carl Hancock, co-founder of Gravity Forms, contends that offering a framework-agnostic approach to building Gutenblocks will have little influence on developers who are extending the project. The decision cannot be made less critical by offering more flexibility, because developers will inevitably adopt whatever WordPress core uses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People are going to end up adopting whatever core uses for the most part despite the rainbows and butterflies some are claiming as it relates to creating an abstraction layer so plugin/theme developers can use whatever they want,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;Which means however complex that core framework ends up being will have a direct impact on the barrier to entry for plugin and theme developers. That barrier to entry has been historically low to date and a direct contributor to the growth of WordPress as a self-hosted CMS. Dramatically raising that barrier to entry isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For example, Gravity Forms will use Preact, Vue, whatever, because we have the manpower and skillset to do so when we can finally decide to do so once core makes it’s decision.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress&#8217; Opportunity to Advance the Web</h3>\n<p>WordPress currently powers 28% of all websites, according to <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">W3 Techs</a>, and whatever framework it chooses will make a major impact on which library many developers decide to learn in order to extend the software and advance their careers.</p>\n<p>Matías Ventura, one of the technical leads on the Gutenberg project, encouraged participants in the discussion to look at the bigger picture and embrace the opportunity to work together and collaborate on a solution for WordPress that will advance the web. The team&#8217;s efforts to collaborate with representatives from competing frameworks stands apart in an ecosystem that is generally fragmented and fractious.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m excited about the opportunity we have to advance web development in terms of JavaScript UI representation, in a similar way to how WordPress was a driving force for web standards during the past decade,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;That’s also where I see us having a responsibility as a project, as people will continue to learn web development through WP. Many people have been introduced to PHP through WordPress, originally just interacting with WP functions and APIs, eventually diving a bit more deeply into the language as needed. I do see our core remaining close to JS the language, as that gives the most meaningful tool to learn, spanning across all frameworks and libraries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura assured participants in the ongoing discussion that the Gutenberg team is listening and working towards a solution that will push the web forward.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are absolutely aware that how we build and what we offer through Gutenberg is going to affect the dev community and we are not taking this lightly—quite the opposite,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;I’ve been talking with Evan (Vue) and Jason (Preact) because rather than having a &#8216;choose your framework&#8217; contest, this seems an opportunity to collaborate and push the web forwards.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 22:26:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"WPTavern: DonateWC Reaches Fundraising Goal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75001\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://wptavern.com/donatewc-reaches-fundraising-goal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1702:\"<p><a href=\"https://donatewc.org/\">DonateWC</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/donatewc-aims-to-provide-travel-sponsorships-to-attend-large-wordcamps\">an initiative</a> focused on providing less fortunate people an opportunity to attend large WordCamps has <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/news/surprise-our-goal-is-fully-funded/\">reached its fundraising goal</a> of 1,000€.

The event was designed for people who use WordPress to manage publications and also to encourage collaboration among project maintainers who build open source tools for publishers.</p>\n<p>In addition to hands-on technical workshops, the <a href=\"https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/schedule/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">schedule</a> included a variety of publishing-related topics, such as monetization, content distribution, newsletter tools, and print and digital workflows.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The schedule prompted a great deal of learning and discussion that extended well beyond the content typically found at a regional WordCamp,&#8221; attendee Maura Teal <a href=\"https://mlteal.com/2017/08/wordcamp-publishers-denver/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;One of the best aspects of this conference was chatting with other developers and leaders involved in media on the web. There were multiple sessions and hallway discussions that brought intriguing solutions to the table. My primary takeaway was that there certainly needs to be more WordCamps of this kind &#8211; that is, focused on a niche but still rooted in community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The unique format of the event offered more small group opportunities than a traditional WordCamp does for learning, asking questions, and collaborating around tools and strategies that directly relate to publishers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp for Publishers was not your average or typical WordCamp,&#8221; attendee Dwayne McDaniel <a href=\"https://www.mcdwayne.com/2017/08/21/wordcamp-for-publishers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;It felt a lot more like WPCampus insofar as the general mood and feeling I got from the participants. Getting to see folks from competing media companies openly discussing how to solve their common challenges, I learned a whole lot and I am grateful to have had the chance to learn about the publishing space.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Videos for all of the sessions held in the auditorium are now available in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp4P7UHKK-kC1CGF3LDtfPDwtLEzDKiP9\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube playlist</a>.

WordPress 4.8 added the new audio, image, and video widgets from this feature plugin. The gallery widget is targeted for merge into the upcoming WordPress 4.9 release.</p>\n<p>In testing the new feature I found it to be a simple, straightforward implementation of a gallery widget that could easily replace many plugins that are currently filling this need for users. The option to edit or replace a gallery is immediately available and users can easily rearrange or randomize the images included.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/core-gallery-widget.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>On the frontend the gallery displays neatly in a thumbnail grid. I was able to change the number of columns while editing the gallery, but the preview in the admin did not match the the way the gallery looks on the frontend. The number of columns is correct on the frontend but not in the admin preview. This might cause some confusion for users if it isn&#8217;t fixed before landing in core. Contributors to the plugin are looking at this <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/issues/190#issuecomment-331011895\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-20-at-3.16.22-PM-e1505938641908.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Overall, the implementation is user-friendly and similar to adding galleries in posts and pages. However, the widget could still use some testing, especially with different plugins installed. For example, with Jetpack enabled, users can choose between a thumbnail and a slideshow gallery, but the slideshow option doesn&#8217;t seem to work correctly in the widget. WordPress.org has <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/gallery+widget/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">several hundred plugins</a> that implement some sort of gallery widget and these plugin authors will want to test the new core widget.</p>\n<p>Theme authors will also need to test how the core gallery widget interacts with their themes. After testing the gallery widget with several popular WordPress.org themes, I found that many display the thumbnails with unsightly outlines and unpredictable spacing between images.</p>\n<p>Weston Ruter, who authored the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dev note post</a> when the previous media widgets were introduced in 4.8, said that the paragraph regarding default theme updates is still applicable:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Themes that add custom styles to the MediaElement.js player (namely Twenty Thirteen and Twenty Fourteen) were updated from just styling it within syndicated content, to also include instances within widgets. Most themes don’t restrict styles for captioned images or media players to just post content, that is, limit CSS selectors to classes output by post_class(). If your theme does, make sure to either remove that constraint or include a .widget selector.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ruter said another dev note will be coming with common theme changes that are required to add the right styling for galleries. Users and theme/plugin developers can test the gallery widget right now on 4.8.2 or 4.9-alpha using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-core-media-widgets/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Core Media Widgets</a> plugin. Once the widget is added to WordPress, it will be deactivated in the feature plugin for future releases. Contributors plan to merge the new widget into core next week, provided testing goes well.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 00:35:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 288 – No React.js Framework for Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=74933&preview=true&preview_id=74933\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-288-no-react-js-framework-for-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3046:\"<p>While I was supposed to be on vacation last week, I instead had surgery for a broken ankle.

I had become a part of something bigger than myself.\" /><p>The first time I ever made a WordPress site, I got 180,000 views in 2 days, 253 comments, and (give or take) 7 death threats.</p>\n<p>It was 2014 and I was working on an MBA at Florida State University during the peak of the Jameis Winston controversy, where a football quarterback was accused of rape and protected from prosecution by the university and local police. I had used WordPress before, but not a lot. But, in true democratizing publishing, giving a voice to the voiceless fashion, when I had something I wanted to say, I knew just the thing to get it out there with minimal know-how: a free, single page WordPress.com site.</p>\n<p>I had just returned to Florida from a summer in New York City. To my amazement, I got the life-changing opportunity, paid for by the university’s College of Social Sciences paid, to go up there for a summer of exploration in the social entrepreneurship and technology circles after pitching Florida State on a concept for financial education.</p>\n<h3>Beginning the Journey</h3>\n<p>I had become interested in financial education around the age of 16, when my family became homeless for a month. My mom hadn’t been able to make the rent, so we got kicked out, and then couldn’t find an apartment easily due to my mom’s lack of credit. Later, I started working at a major commercial bank and met hundreds, if not thousands, of people in similar situations (and saw the ways in which major commercial banks don’t help these people, but that’s a different conversation).</p>\n<p>Imagine having been homeless at 16. Then, 6 years later, you’re attending graduate school, funded by the university, and that same university also paid for you to live in the country’s most expensive place for 3 months so that you could learn about executing your ideas on how to make a positive difference through technology entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>You would probably be overcome with gratefulness. But you would also likely be extremely protective of the people making such a thing possible.</p>\n<p>Now imagine, that while Florida State University’s programs making such an impact on you, a football player’s actions are driving the narrative of this place you want to be proud of.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine me, telling the story I just told you, and watching people connect the dots between what institution was making all of this possible for me, and what they had heard of it. “Oh, my God, with the quarterback that raped that girl?” they would say.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would link you to the page I created, but quite honestly, it wasn’t a lot more than a profanity-laden rant (of admittedly epic proportions). But, it got a reaction: she needs to shut the f**k up. She’s completely right. She’s an “attention-seeking whore!”. She’s the story we should be focusing on. She’s just upset her Kickstarter campaign failed.</p>\n<p>There it was: WordPress had amplified my voice, and everyone else’s, too.</p>\n<h3>Finding WordPress Business</h3>\n<p>Today, I’m the lesser-known half of Caldera Labs, makers of Caldera Forms, a top drag-and-drop form building plugin for WordPress. A few weeks ago, we got a one-star review on WordPress.org that called me out by name: “their team is useless, especially Christie Chirinos.” I received caring notes from several seasoned WordPress product developers, reassuring me that these things happen and I ought to not take it personally. “It’s not the first time someone’s been mean to me on the internet, and it probably won’t be the last,” I wrote in a Slack DM to my incredible business partner, the part of Caldera Labs you probably know, Josh Pollock. Josh laughed.</p>\n<p>My road from single-page rants on WordPress.com to WordPress product leadership was actually pretty straightforward, although certainly wrapped in incredible fortune. I kept up that blog for a few months at the request of some of those 253 people (and the dismay of some others). Eventually it was forgotten for my financial education project’s website, which went from Wix to self-hosted WordPress.</p>\n<p>Some months of working on that site made me acutely aware that if I wanted to execute more of my ideas, I should learn more code. I started learning JavaScript and PHP. I met Josh somewhere around that time. He liked my WordPress.com story, and encouraged me to keep learning, while picking my brain on what my almost-finished MBA thought about Caldera Forms.</p>\n<p>A professor asked me if I would work on his academic WordPress website for a fee. I was a broke graduate student, so I said yes. Suddenly I had clients. When I graduated, Josh approached me with a proposal to join him in business. I said yes, but my only condition is that I’m moving back to New York City. Josh said, remote work is the norm.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2118\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen_shot_2017-09-19_at_8.26.20_pm-1024x374.png\" alt=\"Screen shot of Caldera website\" width=\"960\" height=\"351\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the quote-unquote “formal business education,” I was flabbergasted when the full weight of what a WordPress product business entailed hit me. I didn’t understand the community. I didn’t understand the niche’s culture. Much of what I learned were business norms, were completely non-existent in WordPress. I communicated all of this to Josh.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I have no idea what I’m doing.”</p>\n<p>“Of course you don’t, you’ve never done this before.”</p>\n<p>He introduced me to the extensive library of talks on WordPress TV on imposter syndrome.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Diving Into WordCamp</h3>\n<p>For me, it clicked at the inaugural WordCamp US. I showed up to the event looking like a deer caught in the headlights and was welcomed with open arms. I got to put faces to all of the names I had learned in the last half-year, and surprise: they were nice. They were welcoming. They were understanding.</p>\n<p>I scoffed at the idea that I would have anything to contribute on Contributor Day, and then found out that the polyglots team could totally use an immigrant that speaks 4 languages. More importantly, I became completely inspired by the mission of WordPress. I realized that, by total accident (or perhaps completely on purpose), I had become a part of something bigger than myself. I had to stick with it, no matter how hard it was.</p>\n<p>In the year after that, I also began to find a small niche for myself. I became “the girl with the MBA,” smart, young, and clearly lucky. “There’s not a lot of people in the space with your background,” said the host interviewing me on a WordPress podcast. Meanwhile, I’m thinking to myself, “oh my god. I don’t even understand why you invited me. I’m very grateful, but I also really don’t know that much about business. Didn’t you notice? Didn’t anyone tell you?”</p>\n<p>Move forward a year, and results started rolling in. I spoke at 4 WordCamps and many other shows. Josh published his 2016 Year In Review, where he outlined the explosive growth that Caldera Forms experienced at the end of the year and acknowledged the benefit of having partnered with me. He doesn’t know this, but I cried when I read that (now he knows).</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was surreal: the unlikely thing that we set out to do was working.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This year, 2017, has consisted of taking on the next step in that process: teaching myself how to turn all of those thoughts on their heads. I have had to unlearn “why me?” and internalize “why not me?”, and most importantly, practice differentiating the story that I tell myself about myself versus the evidence-based reality.</p>\n<h3>Self Discovery</h3>\n<p>A crucial part of this stage has been learning that what I do does not define who I am. That’s a tired joke where I live. The joke goes that you can go to any bar, and participate in the same script: what’s your name? What do you do? “I’m Christie, and I’m a partner and the business manager at a commercial WordPress plugin shop, Caldera Labs” is a story, and it immediately sparks self-doubt. That isn’t an answer that describes an evidence-based reality, it is an answer that describes a story, and stories by definition require effort to be believed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Who I am, I am learning, is the collection of my experiences, which then drive my priorities in how I do what I do, which is business.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In that podcast interview, I wasn’t told “there aren’t many business managers in the space.” I was told that there weren’t a lot of people with my background in the space. It’s the collection of my stories &#8211; of immigration, difficult childhoods, arguments in business school classrooms and accidentally viral WordPress websites, that perfectly positioned me to do what I’m doing right now.</p>\n<p>The main reason I wanted to write for HeroPress when Topher offered was to take these thoughts out of my story. The more I grow into this role, the more I’m learning that this is especially common with people like me.</p>\n<p>Research is being conducted more and more every day seeking to discover why we don’t become entrepreneurs who fearlessly pursue happiness and high-risk, high-reward situations (the common trope being that privilege is being told to strive to be anything one wants to be, while others are told to strive for an escape from instability).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most of it boils down to the idea that many minorities, women, immigrants, people from low-income households &#8211; take your pick &#8211; have convinced themselves of a story that does not, in fact, reflect the reality of their possibilities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s a shame, because there’s almost as much research that demonstrates that businesses with diverse leadership teams outperform homogeneous teams almost every single time.</p>\n<p>Let’s start talking about this, even if this isn’t something that directly relates to you. Because, if that is the case, chances are that this is a topic that relates to someone you know. Diversity of thought is an important part of our WordPress community narrative. If you are not the person who must assess replacing a story with an evidence-based reality, you may be someone who is positioned to engage in powerful actions to promote diversity of thought, like encouraging someone else to challenge the stories they tell themselves and the stories they tell others about themselves. “I’m Christie, and I lead all of the business development and marketing for a commercial WordPress plugin shop, Caldera Labs” sounds a lot better.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=What%20I%20Do%20Does%20Not%20Define%20Who%20I%20Am&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fwhat-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am%2F&title=What+I+Do+Does+Not+Define+Who+I+Am\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/092017-150x150.jpg&description=What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/\" title=\"What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/what-i-do-does-not-define-who-i-am/\">What I Do Does Not Define Who I Am</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 12:00:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"Christie Chirinos\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.8.2 Patches Eight Security Vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74914\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-8-2-patches-eight-security-vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:840:\"<p>WordPress 4.8.2 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/wordpress-4-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/\">is available for download</a> and users are encouraged to update as soon as possible.

Version 3.2 is on track to make the process of updating stores a smoother experience with a long-awaited new feature that displays version compatibility checks to users prior to updating their extensions.</p>\n<p>Many WooCommerce store owners experienced considerable difficulties in updating to version 3.0 due to incompatibilities with extensions that were not fully compatible. The widespread problems with updating caused a direct hit to the plugin&#8217;s reputation, even though the main issue was with third-party extensions not being ready to go for 3.0. WooCommerce 3.2&#8217;s new pre-update extension version checks will help users to be more informed about the status of extension compatibility before updating.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce plugin developers can now add two new headers to their extensions to specify a minimum required version and a &#8220;tested up to&#8221; version.<br />\n<code><br />\n/*<br />\n * Plugin Name: WooCommerce Barter Gateway<br />\n * Plugin URI: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-barter/<br />\n * Description: Take payments by bartering crops and livestock.<br />\n * Author: WooCommerce<br />\n * Author URI: https://woocommerce.com/<br />\n * Version: 3.0.7<br />\n * Text Domain: woocommerce-gateway-barter<br />\n * Domain Path: /languages<br />\n * WC requires at least: 3.0.0<br />\n * WC tested up to: 3.2.0<br />\n */</code></p>\n<p>Plugin authors are recommended to update these headers after each major and minor WooCommerce release. (Patch releases do not require headers to be updated.)</p>\n<p>The core WooCommerce plugin will check through the extension headers and display a warning to users when updates are available, detailing which plugins have or haven&#8217;t been tested with the latest major version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pre-update-extension-version-checks.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WooCommerce developer Claudiu Lodromanean cited several important benefits for extension developers in a <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/new-version-check-in-woocommerce-3-2/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> announcing the new feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will have to field fewer complaints from users that the new WooCommerce version broke your plugin. They will have clear warnings about the dangers of upgrading when the plugin is incompatible. This should reduce your support load when new versions of WooCommerce are released.</li>\n<li>You will not have to rush updates to your plugin. If a user upgrades WooCommerce and your plugin breaks you are under a lot of pressure to release an update fast. If the user waits until a compatible version of the plugin is released before updating WooCommerce you do not have this problem.</li>\n<li>Users will trust your plugin more. By adding the header you are letting the user know that the plugin has been tested, works with their version of WooCommerce, and is actively maintained to be compatible with WooCommerce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The pre-update version checks for extensions is an exciting improvement for store owners and the greater WooCommerce developer community. Updates will be much easier when users can see at a glance which of their extensions are ready to go. Developers are also <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/08/28/new-version-check-in-woocommerce-3-2/#comment-3635\" target=\"_blank\">interested in seeing this feature applied for themes</a> and the WooCommerce team confirmed they will look into the possibility.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2017/09/19/important-update-woocommerce-3-2-will-now-be-released-october-11th/\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce 3.2&#8217;s release date</a> has been pushed back one week to October 11 to give store owners and extension developers enough time to test.

As Vue is once again among the leading contenders, I reached out to Vue.js creator Evan You to get his perspective on the possibility of WordPress adopting the framework.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, I had a conversation with the WordPress team mostly answering questions they had about Vue,&#8221; You said. &#8220;The discussion happened before Matt&#8217;s announcement of moving away from React. It was mostly intended for filling the team in with the state of Vue and there was no particular conclusion made from it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I got the feeling that the team had already decided to go with React and simply wanted to explore other options before they make the final call. I was a bit surprised by Matt&#8217;s post, but also understand the concerns behind that decision. I think React is a technically sound choice, and the whole patent issue is unfortunate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vue is back in the mix alongside Preact.js and other libraries WordPress core contributors are considering adopting. You has been active in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/31/javascript-chat-summary-for-may-30th/#comment-32642\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a> on the WordPress core development blog during the previous discussion, as well as more recently in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2733#issuecomment-330124938\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> in Gutenberg&#8217;s GitHub repo, clarifying misconceptions about the financial stability of the project.</p>\n<p>You has been careful to disclose his bias when participating in conversations about which framework WordPress should adopt. During my interview with him, he offered the community three reasons why he sees Vue as a good fit for the project:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now that WP has decided to pick a different framework, as the creator of Vue, I surely hope that the WordPress team can adopt Vue,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Below is why I believe Vue would be a good fit for the choice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;As an independent open source project (not born from within a major corporate), Vue provides a good alignment in terms of OSS values with the WordPress project. It&#8217;s fully MIT licensed, and its development is sustained by open financial contribution channels (via Patreon and OpenCollective). This means WordPress can easily ensure Vue&#8217;s sustainability by becoming a major sponsor.</li>\n<li>&#8220;Vue is one of the most approachable frameworks out there, with an established and active community, and ever-growing amount of learning resources. Adopting Vue would provide a low entry barrier and smooth learning curve for devs just getting into WordPress development. This also aligns with what made WordPress successful.</li>\n<li>&#8220;As an incrementally adoptable framework, Vue&#8217;s flexibility means it can be adapted in different use cases ranging from embedded widgets, plugin development to full single-page applications. It can be used without any compilation step in simple use cases, while being mature and powerful enough for more complex use cases such as Calypso and Gutenberg. It offers the complete stack from vdom + ability to use raw render functions, server-side rendering, routing, state management, build tooling, browser devtool extensions, to editor tooling support.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Evan You and six others from the Vue.js core team will be participating in an <a href=\"https://hashnode.com/ama/with-vuejs-team-cj7itlrki03ae62wuv2r2005s\" target=\"_blank\">AMA on Hashnode at 12PM on September 20</a>, inviting general questions about the project, how to use it and contribute, and general programming advice. The questions are already rolling in and their answers should provide more information about the future of Vue and its place in the wider JavaScript ecosystem.</p>\n<p>WP Tavern has also reached out to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_developit\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Miller</a>, creator of Preact.js to get his perspective on the possibility of WordPress selecting Preact and what it would mean for both projects. The React-alternative is another strong contender among JS libraries WordPress is looking at for use in core.</p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team has been working to ensure that WordPress developers will be able to create &#8220;Gutenblocks&#8221; using any JS library they prefer with different explorations of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\" target=\"_blank\">framework-agnostic block rendering</a>. Ultimately, this would make creating plugins and themes less dependent on the library that is chosen for use in core. Other community members involved in the discussion, however, are keen to emphasize that the framework selected will have an impact on the greater WordPress product ecosystem, far beyond its use in Gutenberg, and are not eager to down play it as a simple technical decision. We&#8217;ll have a more detailed look on that in a separate post.</p>\n<p>In addition to the discussions on independent blogs, the Gutenberg GitHub issues queue and the #core-js channel on WordPress Slack are both hosting active conversations on the upcoming decision.

HeroPress started out to be a voice for people on the fringe of WordPress, and being outside the ability to go to WordCamp practically defines the fringe.</p>\n<p>I never could figure out the logistics of how to make it work. How is money handled? International law? So the idea languished.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the world, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/getting-a-life/\">Ines van Essen</a> had the same idea. She&#8217;s far more clever than I though, and she&#8217;s making it happen. She&#8217;s starting a new organization called DonateWC, specifically to help people get to WordCamp.  Not just local WordCamps, but the large ones like WordCamp Europe and WordCamp US. Trips that can cost multiple months, or even a years salary.</p>\n<p>I am so so so excited that this is happening, Ines is my hero.</p>\n<h2>How You Can Help</h2>\n<p>To get things really rolling Ines needs some funds.  I mentioned logistics earlier; if this isn&#8217;t handled properly a tax agent somewhere is going to come investigating. A non-profit org needs to be created, a logo needs to be created, a site needs to be built, a board needs to be formed, etc. Getting started costs money.</p>\n<p>So <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/startup-cost-for-donatewc\">there&#8217;s a GoFundMe page for DonateWC</a>. All things considered she&#8217;s not looking for very much money right now, we can DO THIS.</p>\n<p>If we can make this thing work it&#8217;s going to really change lives. Please help out if you can, and keep an eye on the project. The first person to get sent to WordCamp is going to make history.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=DonateWC%3A%20Getting%20People%20to%20WordCamp&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fdonatewc-getting-people-wordcamp%2F&title=DonateWC%3A+Getting+People+to+WordCamp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/23950564_1505660479.8301-150x150.png&description=DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/\" title=\"DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/donatewc-getting-people-wordcamp/\">DonateWC: Getting People to WordCamp</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 17 Sep 2017 20:42:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: Vue Project Launches Community Campaign on OpenCollective\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74756\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/vue-project-launches-community-campaign-on-opencollective\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4392:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-15-at-2.13.34-PM-e1505502876371.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>With the recent news that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress is abandoning React</a> due to its BSD + Patents license, core contributors are now revisiting the discussion of the merits of other frameworks. Gutenberg development is currently on hold until a new library is chosen to replace React, and selection is likely to be imminent to prevent further delay.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Vue</a> is once again a strong contender with a recent surge in enthusiastic support in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2733\" target=\"_blank\">discussions on GitHub</a>, Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1624213760974165/\" target=\"_blank\">social</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1624383604290514/\" target=\"_blank\">media</a> posts. One of the chief concerns WordPress core contributors had regarding Vue in previous discussions was the longevity of the project and its dependence on creator <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/vue-js-creator-evan-you-weighs-in-on-wordpress-javascript-framework-discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Evan You</a>, who has historically done most of the development.</p>\n<p>The Vue project has recently been taking steps to mitigate this drawback. Earlier this week You announced that <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-is-now-on-opencollective-1ef89ca1334b\" target=\"_blank\">Vue is now accepting financial support on OpenCollective</a>, a platform for funding open source projects in a transparent way. You already has a successful <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/evanyou\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon campaign</a> where contributors are paying $8,815 per month to support his work on Vue, but the new <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/vuejs\" target=\"_blank\">OpenCollective account</a> will support the work of core contributors and community events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I started the Patreon campaign, the primary goal was providing myself with enough income so that I can work on Vue full-time,&#8221; You said. &#8220;Today, as the Vue community grows, there are more and more contributions from the community, and OpenCollective’s transparent expense model could help us scale the financial contributions beyond a single developer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just four days after launching, Vue already has an estimated annual budget of $9,895 on its OpenCollective account. You is still independently accepting contributions on Patreon to fund his full-time work on the project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://preactjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Preact</a>, the other leading contender WordPress core contributors are considering, has had an <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/preact\" target=\"_blank\">account on OpenCollective</a> since late 2016. Backers and sponsors have contributed to a $16,091 estimated annual budget for the project.</p>\n<p>Both Vue and Preact have growing networks of financial supporters and are not heavily influenced by a single corporation&#8217;s interests. WordPress core contributors continue to discuss the merits and drawbacks of the two frameworks on various places around the web, but the discussion is somewhat scattered and it&#8217;s difficult for participants to know where their feedback will receive consideration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main options are actually all pretty good, and we&#8217;d probably be fine going with any of them, which is makes it a tough decision — objectively and technically there isn&#8217;t one clear without-a-doubt winner,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg said today in WordPress&#8217; #core-js Slack channel.</p>\n<p>An updated post detailing the frameworks and technical considerations that contributors are now examining has yet to be published to the make/wordpress.org development blog. Having communication throughout the process of selecting the framework, instead of announcing it after the decision, would go a long way towards keeping the community informed and involved. We&#8217;ll be following the public discussion as it develops.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 19:54:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"WPTavern: WordPress Abandons React due to Patents Clause, Gutenberg to be Rewritten with a Different Library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74834\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-abandons-react-due-to-patents-clause-gutenberg-to-be-rewritten-with-a-different-library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7411:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wrinkled-paper.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/6XVYR9HYNT\">	Lalesh Aldarwish</a>\n<p>This evening Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> on his blog that WordPress has decided to move away from React due to its BSD + Patents clause licensing. Gutenberg engineers will be rewriting the new editor to use another JavaScript framework and Automattic plans to rewrite Calypso as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#8217;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same. I’ve been sitting on that post, hoping that the patent issue would be resolved in a way we were comfortable passing down to our users.</p>\n<p>That post won&#8217;t be published, and instead I&#8217;m here to say that the Gutenberg team is going to take a step back and rewrite Gutenberg using a different library. It will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg clarified that Automattic has been happy with React and that the company&#8217;s general counsel <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367\" target=\"_blank\">didn&#8217;t think they would ever run into the patent issue</a>. He also commended Facebook on being &#8220;one of the better open source contributors out there&#8221; and for making their intentions clear. Ultimately, Mullenweg decided that he wasn&#8217;t comfortable with the larger WordPress community inheriting the patents clause:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso — that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the long-term consistency with core is worth more than a short-term hit to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After the Apache Software Foundation added Facebook&#8217;s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses, many open source project leaders and developers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/react-users-petition-facebook-to-re-license-react-js-after-apache-software-foundation-bans-bsdpatents-license-in-dependencies\" target=\"_blank\">petitioned Facebook to consider re-licensing React</a>, as many React-based projects are now having to be rewritten. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/facebook-isnt-budging-on-reacts-bsd-patents-license\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook decided it wasn&#8217;t budging on the patents clause</a> and opted to continue protecting its own interests, fully recognizing that it may lose some React community members.</p>\n<p>In the past Mullenweg has been outspoken about how Automattic was betting on React. Many in the community considered WordPress adopting React to be a foregone conclusion, given that both Calypso and Jetpack&#8217;s new admin interface were built on it, as well as WordPress&#8217; new Gutenberg editor. In making the costly decision to rewrite Gutenberg and Automattic&#8217;s products in another library, Mullenweg has demonstrated he is willing to lead the WordPress project in a direction where the community can feel confident about continuing to use and extend the software.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The decision on which library to use going forward will be another post; it’ll be primarily a technical decision,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people. Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we&#8217;re always listening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg could certainly use the extra time and may gain a new crop of contributors, given that the learning curve for the new library isn&#8217;t likely to be as steep as learning React.</p>\n<p>At the end of May, WordPress core contributors had <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-javascript-framework-debate-heats-up-contributors-narrow-discussion-to-react-vs-vue\" target=\"_blank\">narrowed their considerations for a new JavaScript framework to React and Vue</a>. It appears that <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Vue</a> is still a strong contender. After a commenter on Mullenweg&#8217;s post suggested switching to Vue, he replied that it has been frequently suggested and that the team has met with Evan You, Vue&#8217;s lead developer.</p>\n<p>When I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/vue-js-creator-evan-you-weighs-in-on-wordpress-javascript-framework-discussion\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed Evan You in June</a>, he said he didn&#8217;t have enough perspective on WordPress core to make an unbiased recommendation but offered feedback on some technical issues being discussed at the time. He also clarified some common misconceptions about Vue, which WordPress&#8217; React proponents had been using as leverage in their arguments against adopting it.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg also confirmed in the comments of his post that <a href=\"https://preactjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Preact</a> is another library under consideration. Preact.js is a lightweight 3kB alternative to React that uses the same API but is MIT-licensed. Some are already speculating about Preact being the front-runner for the replacement, as Gutenberg already has a branch devoted to trying it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There is a Preact “try” Gutenberg branch. But there is no Vue.js “try” Gutenberg branch. <a href=\"https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b\">https://t.co/mFRYTLIV3b</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Carl Hancock <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f680.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@carlhancock) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/908510738066657281\">September 15, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, Mullenweg&#8217;s comment that the decision &#8220;will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year,&#8221; seems to only be feasible if the team rewrites the project using Preact.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For Gutenberg, not Calypso.

Many are thankful and relieved that Mullenweg made the tough decision to change course and select another library after investing so heavily in React.</p>\n<p>The discussion regarding the new framework continues behind closed doors and is not open to the public, although a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2732\" target=\"_blank\">pull request for using Preact in Gutenberg</a> is open on the project&#8217;s GitHub repo and some community discussion regarding the library selection is happening there.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 05:39:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Matt: On React and WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47558\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2017/09/on-react-and-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3758:\"<p>Big companies like to bury unpleasant news on Fridays: A few weeks ago, <a href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/\">Facebook announced</a> they have decided to dig in on their patent clause addition to the React license, even after Apache had said <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-303\">it’s no longer allowed for Apache.org projects</a>.

I appreciate that they&#x27;ve made their intentions going forward clear.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, Automattic used React as the basis for the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/\">ground-up rewrite of WordPress.com we called Calypso</a>, I believe it&#x27;s one of the larger React-based open source projects. As our general counsel wrote, <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/650#issuecomment-235086367\">we made the decision that we&#x27;d never run into the patent issue</a>. That is still true today as it was then, and overall, we’ve been really happy with React. More recently, the WordPress community started to use React for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/02/17/dev-chat-summary-february-15th-4-7-3-week-3/\">Gutenberg</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/\">the largest core project we&#x27;ve taken on in many years</a>. People&#x27;s experience with React and the size of the React community &#8212;  including Calypso &#8212; was a factor in trying out React for Gutenberg, and that made React the new de facto standard for WordPress and the tens of thousands of plugins written for WordPress.</p>\n<p>We had a many-thousand word announcement talking about how great React is and how we&#x27;re officially adopting it for WordPress, and encouraging plugins to do the same. I’ve been sitting on that post, hoping that the patent issue would be resolved in a way we were comfortable passing down to our users.</p>\n<p>That post won&#x27;t be published, and instead I&#x27;m here to say that <strong>the Gutenberg team is going to take a step back and rewrite Gutenberg using a different library</strong>. It will likely delay Gutenberg at least a few weeks, and may push the release into next year.</p>\n<p>Automattic will also use whatever we choose for Gutenberg to rewrite Calypso — that will take a lot longer, and Automattic still has no issue with the patents clause, but the <em>long-term consistency</em> with core is worth more than a <em>short-term hit</em> to Automattic’s business from a rewrite. Core WordPress updates go out to over a quarter of all websites, having them all inherit the patents clause isn’t something I’m comfortable with.</p>\n<p>I think Facebook’s clause is actually clearer than many other approaches companies could take, and Facebook has been one of the better open source contributors out there. But we have a lot of problems to tackle, and convincing the world that Facebook’s patent clause is fine isn’t ours to take on. It’s their fight. </p>\n<p>The decision on which library to use going forward will be another post; it’ll be primarily a technical decision. We’ll look for something with most of the benefits of React, but without the baggage of a patents clause that’s confusing and threatening to many people. Thank you to everyone who took time to share their thoughts and give feedback on these issues thus far — we&#x27;re always listening.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:59:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: First WordCamp Dublin Set for October 14-15\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74595\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wptavern.com/first-wordcamp-dublin-set-for-october-14-15\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4577:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dublin.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.ireland.com/en-us/what-is-available/sightseeing/destinations/republic-of-ireland/dublin/dublin-city/\">Ireland.com</a>\n<p>Following up on the success of WordCamp Belfast last October, the WordPress community in <a href=\"https://2017.dublin.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Dublin will be hosting its first WordCamp October 14-15</a>. Both camps <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-meetup-groups-in-belfast-and-dublin-are-planning-wordcamps-for-2016-and-2017\" target=\"_blank\">began the early stages of planning last year</a> and the two communities have shared some of the same organizers across their teams to help get these new camps off the ground in Ireland.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will be held at <a href=\"http://business.dcu.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">DCU Business School</a> and ticket sales will be capped at 250. In truly affordable WordCamp tradition, tickets are only €35 and include access to two tracks of speakers on both camp days, catered lunch, and an after party on Saturday night in Dublin City Centre.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Given it’s our first WordCamp Dublin it’s difficult to select a venue when we’ve no idea about how many people would like to attend,&#8221; co-organizer Colm Troy said. &#8220;But demand so far has been great so if you want a ticket I’d recommend getting one sooner rather than later.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Most of the camp&#8217;s five organizers are also part of the Dublin WordPress meetup, which is fairly active with 25-30 people attending regularly. They meet the first Thursday of every month and host a local speaker to teach attendees something new. WordPress developers generally gravitate towards the more technical talks, while WordPress users are more interested in talks about improving and promoting their websites.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Dublin will feature one track with advanced WordPress, coding, and development topics and a second track that covers aspects of running a business, growing website traffic, podcasting, and other related topics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;​The Dublin WordPress community, based on what I’ve seen and experienced elsewhere (Buenos Aires, Paris, Vienna, UK, Italy), is pretty unusual,&#8221; co-organizer Rodolfo Melogli said. In addition to co-organizing the local WordPress meetup, Melogli also organizes the Dublin E-commerce and WooCommerce Meetups.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have complete beginners, who after years of using other CMSs have finally decided to start using WordPress,&#8221; Melogli said. &#8220;We have passionate bloggers, who have been exploiting the SEO and content management features of WordPress since the very beginning. Then, we&#8217;ve got successful themers, popular plugin developers and experienced WordPress freelancers. Making sure everyone is catered for at each WordPress meetup and at the upcoming WordCamp is our biggest challenge and main priority.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The beautiful thing about the WordPress community, and especially in Dublin, is that you can have a successful theme seller sitting beside a complete beginner. And they both have things to share.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Organizers have just announced the <a href=\"https://2017.dublin.wordcamp.org/speakers-2017/\" target=\"_blank\">full lineup of speakers</a> for the WordCamp and co-organizer Colm Troy said the team was &#8220;blown away by the quality and quantity of excellent speaking applications&#8221; they received.</p>\n<p>The camp&#8217;s designers have created a new &#8220;blocky&#8221; style wapuu for the occasion to accompany the event&#8217;s modular design theme. They were aiming for a Lego-like wapuu while incorporating the cosmopolitan landmark &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire_of_Dublin\" target=\"_blank\">Spire of Dublin</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-dublin-2017.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;​We have a couple of ideas floating around that will definitely add a unique Irish aspect to WordCamp Dublin but it’s too early to let the cat out of the bag on those yet,&#8221; Troy said. &#8220;In terms of what people can expect, Dublin and Ireland in general has a well earned reputation as one of the most welcoming places in the world. In many ways, our welcoming spirit is closely aligned with the ethos of the WordPress community and I think it’s going to be a really special weekend for attendees regardless of whether they’re new to WordPress or WordCamp veterans.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 21:15:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: GitHub Partners with Facebook to Release Atom-IDE\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74752\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wptavern.com/github-partners-with-facebook-to-release-atom-ide\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3269:\"<p>GitHub <a href=\"http://blog.atom.io/2017/09/12/announcing-atom-ide.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the launch of Atom-IDE this week, a new set of packages that extend its open source JavaScript-powered code editor to include IDE-like functionality.

WordPress developers have created <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/search?q=WordPress\" target=\"_blank\">more than a dozen packages</a> that support actions and filters, WP-CLI commands, documentation, and snippets for third-party plugins.</p>\n<p>Those who have adopted Atom appreciate its extendability, but the most common complaint from the Atom community is that the code editor is noticeably <a href=\"https://discuss.atom.io/t/why-is-atom-so-slow/11376/193\" target=\"_blank\">slower than many others</a>. This has been a frequent <a href=\"https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-is-painfully-slow/36298\" target=\"_blank\">topic</a> of <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8989606\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> for several years and its creators admit that <a href=\"https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-feels-slow-or-is-consuming-too-much-cpu-or-memory/32662?source_topic_id=36298\" target=\"_blank\">performance isn&#8217;t one of its strongest features</a>. However, sometimes extreme performance issues can be caused by a package that a user has installed.</p>\n<p>Atom partnered with Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https://nuclide.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Nuclide</a> project developers to develop the new <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui\" target=\"_blank\">Atom IDE UI</a> package that uses Atom’s <a href=\"https://github.com/atom/atom-languageclient\" target=\"_blank\">atom-languageclient</a> library in displaying features supported by the <a href=\"http://langserver.org/\" target=\"_blank\">language server protocol</a>. Users who want to get started with Atom-IDE will need to install the Atom IDE UI package as well as an IDE language support package (i.e. <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/ide-php\" target=\"_blank\">ide-php</a>).</p>\n<p>Using Atom-IDE currently requires Atom Beta 1.21+. In the future the team plans to add support for more languages, which will most likely happen through outside package contributions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the help of our community, we plan to expand the number of languages that Atom-IDE can support and make it possible for you to run and edit applications, making Atom-IDE a true IDE,&#8221; Damien Guard said. &#8220;We hope to see future language support for the great languages out there including Rust, Go, Python, etc.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 02:12:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Display Widgets Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Malicious Code\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74768\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6033:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/display-widgets/\" target=\"_blank\">Display Widgets</a>, a plugin with more than 200,000 active installs, has been removed from WordPress.org due to its authors inserting malicious code.

According to their independent investigation, the plugin included a backdoor that allowed the plugin author to publish spam content to the sites where Display Widgets is installed. It also prevented logged-in users from being able to see the content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pagely.com/blog/2017/09/malicious-code-display-widgets/\" target=\"_blank\">Pagely banned the Display Widgets plugin</a> from its hosting platform this week:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For our customer’s safety, we have banned the plugin from our customer sites&#8230;The plugin will remained banned on our network until a time that we see someone has taken responsibility for the plugin and the future of patching its code.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets had recently changed hands, as it was acquired from the team that created Formidable Forms.

They do not receive a notice in the WordPress admin about the plugin having been removed from the directory. Since Display Widgets was a fairly popular plugin, there are likely many sites that still have it active and those website owners are probably unaware of the spam content they are publishing.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the plugin team issued a notice that <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-2-7-is-safe/\" target=\"_blank\">Display Widgets 2.7 is a clean version</a> that restores the plugin to version 2.0.5 before the malicious code was added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will be leaving this version deploying updates, however at this time we will NOT be allowing for its adoption.

It’s not supported, it’s not worked on, nothing. So if you have it, upgrade. Otherwise, find something else to use.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets is now likely to end up in the graveyard of abandoned plugins, but there are many other options for adding conditional widget display to WordPress sites.

One meta trac <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2627\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> requests that closed plugins have a public page instead of disappearing completely. In another related <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2860\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a>, plugin team member Mika Epstein has proposed that when plugins are closed or disabled, there should be a dropdown for WordPress.org admins to select a reason why. She suggested the following as available options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security Issue</li>\n<li>Author Request</li>\n<li>Guideline Violation</li>\n<li>Licensing/Trademark violations</li>\n<li>Merged into Core</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The issue with Display Widgets was fairly public as users posted about their investigations on the WordPress.org support forums and various companies issued warnings about it. However, many plugins are disabled without the public knowing why. Even a short explanation like the proposed examples above would be a major improvement over leaving WordPress.org plugin users in the dark. It would assist site owners in knowing whether they need to prioritize looking for an alternative or simply wait until the situation is resolved.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 20:08:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"HeroPress: Making My Own Normal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2098\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=making-my-own-normal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8262:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine.\" /><p>As long as I can remember being normal was my only goal in life.

You see, everybody was going through life living by certain rules and I lived my life not knowing those rules. Nobody told me, but apparently they told everybody else.</p>\n<h3>Understanding</h3>\n<p>When I was 35 I got diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. I cannot tell you how relieved I was after receiving such a clear diagnoses. All those years working so hard to fit in there was an explanation why I didn’t. Why I couldn’t. That was a big deal. It was not that I wouldn&#8217;t that I didn’t try hard enough or was to lazy. There was something different about me why I couldn’t. Not understanding the rules of life? Being clumsy and inappropriate in social situation? Being obsessed about some things and totally not interested in others? It was all part of the package.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting the right diagnosis changed everything and at the same time it didn’t change anything.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problems I had to face were still the same. The way to handle them just got more clear. And there was help. I started reading books, I started therapy and I started working with a coach to find a way to integrate this new knowledge into my life. I started looking at what I needed (what??) and finding ways to take care of myself. I really thought this was it. I found the keys, I could learn the rules and finally be a normal person.</p>\n<p>And then I got fired.</p>\n<p>Having a job was a big part of being normal in my head. Getting fired ruined my chances of ever getting there. I was working as an assistant manager in the local library. I liked my job, and the people I worked with and they liked me. I loved going to work. But the library had to cut their expenses and I was one of the people that got fired. It happens but I was completely shocked.</p>\n<p>My experiences with jobs were not good (to put it mildly). There wasn’t one I kept longer than 2 years. You can do the math; I had a lot of jobs since I started working. Some were fun most were not. I got fired many of times. Getting fired was not a new thing. Liking a job and not wanting to get fired and getting fired anyway was what upset me the most. So I decided to start my own company.</p>\n<h3>Taking Control</h3>\n<p>Looking back it was a ridiculous plan but strangely enough, it worked out. I started helping people with their Social Media and building website with WordPress.</p>\n<p>I learned WordPress for fun. I wasn’t interested in computers or tech stuff. I was just a little obsessed with making a website for the domain name my boyfriend gave me for my birthday a few years earlier. I had nothing to say but was totally fascinated by what you can do with a website. It was like magic to me. Some written code turned into a beautiful page, or an ugly one. I wanted to know all about that. Building things with HTML and CSS was easy. Code is logic (and poetry of course;-)). It does what you tell it to do. If it doesn’t you did something wrong. Never a discussion about it.</p>\n<p>I shied away from people. It was too confusing for me now that I found something that was so easy and logical.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I could make money without seeing other people, it felt like heaven.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For a while. This is really what makes this whole thing so disturbing. I want to be alone, but also want to be around other people. I appear to be good with people. A lot of people like me (who knew?!). They have no idea how confusing it is not knowing what the underlying rule set is others are acting by. It’s like interacting with someone from a totally different culture speaking a different language but both of you don’t know that. I got really good at guessing things through the years, but that didn’t make it any less uncomfortable. I also got really scared. Because not all people are understanding and friendly when you try to explain.</p>\n<h3>And Then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>In 2011 I went to my first WordPress meetup. I was shocked! These people did what I did and actually knew what they were doing and talked about it. I was blown away with all this new knowledge and information. I needed to know more and learn more. So I went back into my WordPress cave and studied, practiced and learned more.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe happened for the first time in 2013 in The Netherlands. I signed up as a volunteer. I visited WordCamp NL the year before. As a visitor I didn’t know how to meet new people. That was a lonely experience. I loved the knowledge that was shared but I knew I had to find a way to talk to those people. I figured being a volunteer would give me something to do and a reason to talk to people. And it did.</p>\n<p>I met new people, I was shy, I was scared, I acted totally inappropriate and I was exhausted for a week after the event but I did it. The people were nice. Some seem to like me and I had fun. This was a totally new experience. If only this could normal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I attended more WordCamps, always as a volunteer, that was my safe place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My confidence grew. The number of people I knew grew. The amount of fun I had grew. And never ever did I feel not normal. As my confidence grew I got more visible and things got even better. It’s an upward spiral. This year I held my first talk, at WordCamp London. I was MC at WordCamp EU in Paris en I am on the organising team for WordCamp EU 2018 (BIG things!).</p>\n<p>Did these experiences end my quest to becoming “normal”?</p>\n<p>When I turned 40 I decided to quit the quest. I was done trying to be normal. Not because I became normal but I broadened my worldview. There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine. It took me a while ( and a lot of redirections) to find the one that fits me best.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Making My Own Normal\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Making%20My%20Own%20Normal&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Making My Own Normal\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F&title=Making+My+Own+Normal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Making My Own Normal\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-150x150.jpg&description=Making My Own Normal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Making My Own Normal\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/\" title=\"Making My Own Normal\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/\">Making My Own Normal</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:00:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"Wendie Huis in ‘t Veld\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: WordPress.org Adds New Support Rep Role for Plugin Pages\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74726\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-adds-new-support-rep-role-for-plugin-pages\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1424:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/collaboration.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress.org introduced a new feature for plugin pages this week that highlights official support representatives. Plugin authors can now find the UI for adding support reps under the Advanced View on the plugin page. Unlike the contributors and developers role, individual support reps do not have commit access and do not appear on the plugin details page.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/09/04/plugin-support-reps/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;support rep&#8221; role</a> is especially useful for larger plugins that have a support team managing the forum. It includes the ability to mark forum topics as resolved or sticky. Previously, only plugin authors were able to do this, which made it difficult for support teams to fully manage forum topics. Support reps will now have their interactions highlighted in the forum:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/support-rep-reply.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Adding these official indicators to support reps&#8217; replies puts them in context within the thread and lends more authority to their answers. It is a small addition that will allow plugin shops to provide better support to their users.

With billions of dollars flowing through the WordPress economy, tensions are high, as many people support themselves and their families with the revenue earned from products and services that have been built on the existing editor.</p>\n<p>First impressions range from outright rejection of the new editor to those who embrace it and are hopeful for what it will bring to WordPress. For the past several years, most major new features added to WordPress have come through the feature plugin/feature project process where release leads and other contributors decide whether a proposed feature is ready for merge. The Gutenberg project is taking a somewhat different path to core in that Matt Mullenweg has already confirmed that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-addresses-concerns-about-gutenberg-confirms-new-editor-to-ship-with-wordpress-5-0\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0</a>, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready. This approach is part of Mullenweg&#8217;s new strategy for core development that makes releases more project-based instead of time-based.</p>\n<p>One of the most common concerns that developers and agency owners have about the plan to include Gutenberg in 5.0 is that they may need to hold back some of their sites from updating. The most vocal opponents have called for a way to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of Gutenberg so that it isn&#8217;t forced on their users.</p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"http://valiantchickendigital.com/blog/wordpress-new-coke-moment/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress is about to have its New Coke moment</a>,&#8221; Nate Hoffelder shared his first impressions of the new edidtor after taking it for a test run. He said he appreciates the changes it promises but was unable to figure out how to create the blocks in the demo and worries about the &#8220;average non-techie&#8221; trying to use the interface.</p>\n<p>Hoffelder referenced Coca-Cola&#8217;s attempt to introduce New Coke in April 1985, which quickly ended in consumers calling for a return of the original flavor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My gut feeling is that if users share my frustrations with Gutenberg, they will demand the return of the old interface,&#8221; Hoffelder said. &#8220;But the official release is months and months away, so it is entirely possible that a UX (user experience) expert will force the Gutenberg developers to make Gutenberg easier to use before it is inflicted upon an unsuspecting public.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress Users Will be Able to Restore the Old Editor with a Plugin after Gutenberg Lands in Core</h3>\n<p>WordPress will move forward with the Gutenberg editor as the default experience in the 5.0 release, but Matt Mullenweg confirmed in a <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587616\" target=\"_blank\">comment</a> on his blog that a plugin will be available for users who want to restore the old editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg uses TinyMCE, so a better way to think of it is that Gutenberg is a new version of our approach to TinyMCE,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It will be the default experience of WP, for people that want to use something more like what’s currently there we’ll have a plugin they can use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This should bring some relief to developers who will not yet have updated their extensions to work with Gutenberg, as well as agency owners who are not ready to give their clients access to the new editor.</p>\n<p>In his post, titled <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason\" target=\"_blank\">We Called it Gutenberg for a Reason</a>, Mullenweg shared his vision for how the new editor will will re-imagine TinyMCE and the advantages it will bring for plugin editors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Plugin developers will be able to completely integrate into every part of WordPress, including posts, pages, custom post types, and sidebars without having to hack TinyMCE or squeeze their entire feature behind a toolbar button. Today, every plugin that extends WordPress does it in a different way; Gutenberg’s blocks provide a single, easy-to-learn entry point for an incredible variety of extensions. Some folks have already begun to port their plugins over, and are finding that they’re easier to build and have a much improved UI.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For developers who are worried about the compatibility of their metaboxes, Mullenweg said <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587620\" target=\"_blank\">a plugin will be available for providing the legacy edit page for metaboxes</a>. One commenter, whose sites are heavily dependent on Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), asked if there is going to be a version of WordPress that will get long-term support for sites that can&#8217;t be upgraded to 5.0 without breaking.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There won’t be a version of WP like that, but there will definitely be a plugin that gives you the legacy / old edit page. Make sure to let ACF know that Gutenberg compatibility is a top priority,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Scott Kingsley Clark, lead developer of the Pods plugin, said this support for legacy PHP meta boxes is welcome news for the project but that Pods is also looking to get on board with Gutenberg once the project&#8217;s engineers have a solution for metaboxes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m very excited to start using the new meta boxes from Gutenberg once the API supports it and gives us more to utilize,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;As soon as that’s available, count us in for immediate adoption.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite assurances that a plugin will be available to restore the old interface, some are still concerned about how Gutenberg will impact the WordPress ecosystem. The average WordPress user has never heard of Gutenberg and its inclusion in 5.0 will be a major change.</p>\n<p>In a recent article on WPShout Fred Meyer contends that <a href=\"https://wpshout.com/stop-presses-gutenberg-wordpress-needs-doesnt-go-nearly-far-enough/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough</a> towards giving users what they really want, which he identifies as front-end editing and the ability to create layouts within post content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough,&#8221; Meyer said. &#8220;It won’t make WordPress’ core content editor competitive with hosted builder solutions, or even with WordPress’ own themes and plugins (including badly built, bad-for-the-community solutions like Visual Composer.)&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meyer believes Gutenberg has the opportunity to defragment WordPress&#8217; ecosystem of page building tools, but only if it moves towards providing &#8220;a feature-rich, developer-friendly, front-end page builder and content editor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In responding to feedback from the community, Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister has said that the project is currently focusing on editing before tackling the page building experience. The team has also been <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587693\" target=\"_blank\">working with the authors of page builder plugins</a> ahead of the next focus on customization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is still a little early to say what will happen to plugins and builders,&#8221; Lister <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587692\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;Initially, Gutenberg is focusing on the editor. The next stage is for the Customization focus (the building of pages). One thing that will need to happen is a lot of testing of existing plugins with Gutenberg. That’s how we can ensure things do work and limit issues. Ultimately, more and more plugins won’t be needed – or at least not so many together to achieve simple things. This benefits users and creates a better, more unified experience for all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If users&#8217; first impression of Gutenberg is that it is unable to deliver on all of the lofty promises of the project, they may return to the old interface en masse. WordPress will then have a battle to convince users to give it a another chance as the experience improves to include customization.</p>\n<p>Multi-column layouts, which are the gateway to page building, are <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-explore-adding-drag-and-drop-and-multi-column-support-for-blocks\" target=\"_blank\">not currently within the scope of the first official version coming to core</a>. Gutenberg&#8217;s one-dimensional, vertically stacking approach to designing pages isn&#8217;t very inspiring. This may frustrate average users whose expectations have not been tempered with the understanding that a future version will include an expanded page building experience. A plugin that allows users to opt out until it is an improvement over their current tools is going to be crucial for keeping the community happy.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 04:22:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: “The Final Word” Plugin Extends O2 to Pin a Highlighted Comment to the Top of a Thread\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74707\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://wptavern.com/the-final-word-plugin-extends-o2-to-pin-a-highlighted-comment-to-the-top-of-a-thread\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3311:\"<p>&#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-final-word/\" target=\"_blank\">The Final Word</a>&#8221; is a new plugin that extends O2 to highlight a comment at the top of a thread. <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/o2\" target=\"_blank\">O2</a> is the plugin successor to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/p2/\" target=\"_blank\">P2</a>, Automattic&#8217;s group blogging theme that introduced quick posting from the front page with real-time comment updates.

Discussions in the Community P2 often involve decision making, and the plugin is useful for highlighting the team&#8217;s conclusion on a matter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/top-comment.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Final Word gives users who are able to edit the post the ability to mark a specific comment as the &#8220;top comment.&#8221; Other features include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The top comment is displayed at the top of the comment list with a ‘view in context’ anchor link</li>\n<li>The top comment is also highlighted in context in the thread</li>\n<li>Only one comment can be selected as the top comment</li>\n<li>The top comment flag can be removed</li>\n<li>Includes basic styling for top comments</li>\n<li>‘Top comment’ label can be translated and/or filtered</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin currently will not work without 02 enabled because of its specific way of handling comments, but Lashbrooke said it may be updated in the future to work without O2. (While O2 is not theme-dependent, the plugin is also not guaranteed to work with every theme and is recommended to be used in combination with the <a href=\"https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe\" target=\"_blank\">p2-breathe theme</a>.)</p>\n<p>The Final Word is now active on the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Community team&#8217;s blog</a> and is available for other teams to activate as well. With the number of O2 blogs that many contributors are subscribed to, there is a massive amount of information and discussion to keep up with. This plugin gives thread authors and team leaders the ability to summarize conversations and keep them more manageable for readers and participants. The Final Word is available on both <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-final-word/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/hlashbrooke/The-Final-Word\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 04:10:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: Equifax Launches WordPress-Powered Site for Consumers Affected by Security Breach\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74677\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://wptavern.com/equifax-launches-wordpress-powered-site-for-consumers-affected-by-security-breach\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7328:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/security.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/58441544@N00/2660230441\">Lock</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p>Equifax has launched <a href=\"https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a WordPress-powered website</a> to connect with consumers affected by its recent security breach, which compromised 143 million customers&#8217; personal data. The exposed data includes names, birth dates, social security numbers, addresses, credit card numbers, driver&#8217;s license numbers, and other sensitive financial information.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/\" target=\"_blank\">equifaxsecurity2017.com</a> site was launched shortly after disclosure to give consumers information about the security incident. Equifax reports that the company has found no evidence of unauthorized activity on its core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases but is offering free identity theft protection and credit file monitoring services to U.S. consumers who enter their last names and last six digits of their social security number into its form.</p>\n<p>Consumers are rightfully wary of the website, as the company is asking for more personal information in order to sign people up for another one of its products. Various <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/09/08/equifax_breach_notification/\" target=\"_blank\">news</a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/why-the-equifax-breach-is-very-possibly-the-worst-leak-of-personal-info-ever/\" target=\"_blank\">outlets</a> are decrying the fact that the site is built on WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s more, the website which Equifax created to notify people of the breach, is highly problematic for a variety of reasons,&#8221; Ars Technica Security Editor Dan Goodin said. &#8220;It runs on a stock installation WordPress, a content management system that doesn&#8217;t provide the enterprise-grade security required for a site that asks people to provide their last name and all but three digits of their Social Security number.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Goodin also referenced the output of <a href=\"https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users/</a> which earlier in the day exposed the username for the site&#8217;s administrator before the page was protected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/equifax-site-users-endpoint.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; handbook has a section on reporting security vulnerabilities that explains <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/#why-are-disclosures-of-usernames-or-user-ids-not-a-security-issue\" target=\"_blank\">why disclosures of usernames or user IDs is not a security issue</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The WordPress project doesn’t consider usernames or user ids to be private or secure information. A username is part of your online identity. It is meant to identify, not verify, who you are saying you are. Verification is the job of the password.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, people do not consider usernames to be secret, often sharing them openly. Additionally, many major online establishments — such as Google and Facebook — have done away with usernames in favor of email addresses, which are shared around constantly and freely. WordPress has also moved this way, allowing users to log in with an email address or username since version 4.5.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress Core Security Team Lead Aaron Campbell clarified this section of the handbook to confirm that the users endpoint is intended to be an open API endpoint that serves public data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It does in fact include usernames and user IDs (among other things) for users that have published posts in a post type that is set up to use the API, but all the data is considered public,&#8221; Campbell said.</p>\n<p>Campbell also said he is wary of entering personal data into the equifaxsecurity2017.com website, but not because it is using WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the fact that it runs on WordPress is a concern from a security standpoint, with the caveat that I don&#8217;t know what ELSE it&#8217;s using,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;&#8216;Equifax&#8217; is a trusted brand, but it&#8217;s not the official Equifax domain and the SSL certificate doesn&#8217;t verify ownership. So you know your data is encrypted, but not necessarily who it&#8217;s being sent to since you don&#8217;t know who owns the site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Equifax simply didn&#8217;t build out the information site on its own domain. According to security investigator <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Krebs</a>, the company appears to have hired Edelman PR, a global PR firm, to handle its public response to the data breach, citing the username publicly displayed by WordPress&#8217; API. Edelman PR opted to use a free Cloudflare certificate to secure the site.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Not only did <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Equifax\">@Equifax</a> suffer a massive data breach, but their site about the breach is using a free shared CloudFlare SSL cert. ಠ_ಠ <a href=\"https://t.co/r4bvPpde1i\">pic.twitter.com/r4bvPpde1i</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Daniel Lo Nigro (@Daniel15) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Daniel15/status/905953979934187520\">September 8, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Consumers were also off put by the verbiage of the arbitration clause included in the terms and services of the free credit monitoring, which appears to force those who sign up to waive their rights to participate in class action lawsuits against the company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot recall a previous data breach in which the breached company’s public outreach and response has been so haphazard and ill-conceived,&#8221; Krebs said.</p>\n<p>Kenneth White, a security researcher and director of the Open Crypto Audit Project, said on Twitter that he was amazed the site was running stock WordPress but that his comments specifically referenced the sloppy implementation of the site.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">intent wasn\'t to blast WP, this is just sloppy—default admin pages, default nginx errors, wonky certs, phish flagged…</p>\n<p>&mdash; Kenn White (@kennwhite) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kennwhite/status/906152286908551168\">September 8, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Due to how the site was set up, it appeared to many consumers and researchers as Equifax&#8217;s way of stalling or perhaps even scamming those who may have been affected by the breach. Various browsers flagged it as a phishing threat, and some consumers found they were given different answers from the form based on whether they checked with desktop or mobile devices. In responding to the incident with a website that appears to have been hastily implemented for its own convenience and corporate interests, Equifax has missed an opportunity to reclaim any remaining consumer confidence from the public.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 08 Sep 2017 20:04:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WPTavern: SWFUpload Will Officially Be Removed From WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74660\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/swfupload-will-officially-be-removed-from-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2000:\"<p>SWFUpload is an open-source library that was used by WordPress in 2011 and earlier that allowed users to upload files.

Ventura said this is the long-term goal after the project completes the post and page editing milestone.</p>\n<p>The first video shows how Gutenberg can be used for page building, starting with a blank slate and a theme that defines specific styles for blocks. The second one shows how a theme might include templates with blocks already in place that provide users with a guided page-building experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These examples clarify some of the benefits the team is aiming for with Gutenberg and how WordPress theme authors will be able to build more user-friendly experiences on top of the new editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These are quickly put together, but I hope it shows how things can progress even with very straightforward theme integration,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;As soon as we expand the scope and include more blocks (site title, site header, menus, more widgets, etc), and describe a way to store page templates as a «list of blocks», Gutenberg would be fundamentally capable of building an entire website.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 07 Sep 2017 20:02:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 287 – WordPress Meetups, Events, and WordCamps with Andrea Middleton\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=74614&preview=true&preview_id=74614\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-287-wordpress-meetups-events-and-wordcamps-with-andrea-middleton\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1776:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"https://jjj.blog/\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://andreamiddleton.blog/\">Andrea Middleton</a>, Dot org Wrangler at Automattic.

People would know all the neighbors, they would pay each other visits every week to talk about what’s been going on in the community and to have a beer or two. It all seemed great until the moment when I got a bit older and went to Junior High School. My hair, unlike all other boys’, was long and I enjoyed listening to rock / metal music, the genre that was considered weird, unknown, maybe even evil.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Suddenly this friendly community started treating me like an alien, someone they refused to treat as one of their own or spend time with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Almost every day I would get some beatings from school bullies, they would pull my hair, call me names, in short &#8211; my life became miserable. I had to find a way to survive, something to focus on.</p>\n<p>That’s when I started spending even more time with my computer, playing Diablo (I even set up a Diablo fan club which became quite popular in Poland) and other multiplayer games that connected me with new people. All these interesting personalities living there, somewhere far away, (and the unforgettable sound of a dial-up modem) made me believe there was something good out there waiting for me.</p>\n<p>Next, natural step was the analysis of how a game could be created. I spent months looking at the code and analyzing its components. There weren’t many tutorials back then, so sometimes it took a while to figure things out. But it all led to building my first website, which was full of tables and hundreds of colorful elements, everything was there! I was so proud of myself! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>When I went to High School, I already knew a thing or two about coding and I wasn’t afraid to use it! I moved to a big city, got my first job as a graphic designer and started renting my own apartment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was very young, full of energy and determination to change my life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After a while I got another job and another, and suddenly I realized that coding became an essential part of my life. Instead of learning chemistry and biology, I spent my nights learning new ways of improving my skills and finally was offered a pretty sweet job in a huge company, where I led a team of front-end developers. Yes, I was about 19, but I felt so mature. It’s so funny now, when I recall that feeling of accomplishing “everything”, but hey, I knew CSS ‘hacks’ on IE 6, I knew it all!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of course, I had heard of WordPress, but none of the ‘true’ coders would use it, so why would I want to dig into that?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, I’m glad someone helped me change my mind. In 2010 my colleague invited me to join him on WordCamp. In Poland WordPress was still considered a cute little tool for creating internet blogs, so I thought going there would be a waste of time, but it turned out to be a life-changing experience. The opportunity to meet people from different countries, hear them talk about the growing possibilities of WordPress made me realize I was in the right place. The fact that a few people I met there are still my friends today only stresses the importance of that event.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It simply dawned on me that it’s not really about the CMS or other technical elements.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress turned out to be a tool that led me to meeting a fantastic community of interesting and friendly people. And this was one of the reasons I wanted to delve further into WordPress.</p>\n<p>Two years later I started cooperating with a company based in the United States. Their main tool to build sites on was WordPress, obviously. By the way, I’ve been with this company for over 5 years now and to be honest, I can’t imagine my life without those guys now, but I don’t want to keep you here too long, so let’s move on. I quit my safe, ‘nine to five’ job to the dismay of my parents and started working remotely. Everything was so new, so exciting, but at the same time physically and mentally exhausting. I was doing my master’s degree in e-business and I rarely slept through the night, mostly because my clients were from different time zones.</p>\n<p>To make things more exciting, I applied for a grant from the European Union and registered my own little company in Poland. But hey, I still felt unsated. It took me around a year to decide to move my company to the United States and go there to manage it. Actually, part of this time was spent on convincing my wife to quit the job she didn’t like anyway, but again, no subplots.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To say that moving to the States was easy would be a monstrous lie.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dealing with visas and all types of immigration documents is very time-consuming and caused us way too many sleepless nights, but eventually we got to California! I registered my company (again!), opened a bank account (you wouldn’t believe how difficult it was, so thank you, dear Russian lady for fighting with the system for over 2 hours!), and looked for a place to stay.</p>\n<p>Almost 3 years have passed, I’ve been given a chance to work with amazing people whom I truly admire, and I work for and with a few startups that, I admit, are close to my heart. One of the projects my wife and I are working on is a platform (based on WordPress, of course) that will help freelancers find good, well paid projects. Again, right time, right place, no doubt about it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I know you&#8217;ve heard it a thousand times before. But it&#8217;s true &#8211; hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don&#8217;t love something, then don&#8217;t do it.“ (Ray Bradbury)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very often people ask me if it’s all worth it, if I’m a masochist and enjoy burning the midnight oil, but I don’t see it that way. If I have a goal, whether it’s one to create a new website, or learn how to prepare real pierogi (dumplings) for my wife, I’m ready to spend as much time as needed to accomplish it. Sure, if it’s not something I truly ‘feel’, I might not be able to devote 100 percent of my energy to make it happen, but I like to think it’s a matter of making the right choices.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying it’s all rainbows and butterflies right now, I’m not a guy who spends his days surfing or drinking cocktails. To be honest I don’t think I’ll ever be that guy. I’m still working very hard and I rarely take days off, but at least when I go to bed I have a feeling that I’ve done all I could to help others and improve my skills as a front-ender, project manager and most of all, a human being.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Crafting the Life You Want\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Crafting%20the%20Life%20You%20Want&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Crafting the Life You Want\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F&title=Crafting+the+Life+You+Want\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Crafting the Life You Want\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/090617-150x150.jpg&description=Crafting the Life You Want\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Crafting the Life You Want\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/\" title=\"Crafting the Life You Want\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/\">Crafting the Life You Want</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 12:00:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Damian Samolej\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 5.3 Adds PHP 7.1 Compatibility, Better Control for WordAds Placement\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74547\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-3-adds-php-7-1-compatibility-better-control-for-wordads-placement\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2636:\"<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2017/09/05/jetpack-5-3-php-7-1-compatibility/\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 5.3</a> was released with compatibility for PHP 7.1, a task the Jetpack team has been working on <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6106\" target=\"_blank\">since January 2017</a> after they received multiple reports of <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6629\" target=\"_blank\">failures with PHP 7.1 when opcache was enabled</a>. This interfered with XML-RPC requests and some users reported issues managing their sites from WordPress.com and connecting to third-party apps. Downgrading to PHP 7.0 or disabling opcache in PHP 7.1 provided temporary workarounds for many users but this is no longer required as of Jetpack 5.3.</p>\n<p>In January 2017, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-4-5-expands-monetization-with-wordads-integration\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack added integration with WordAds</a>, WordPress.com’s advertising program. Over the past few years the program has evolved to get better at distinguishing sites with higher quality traffic and allocating earnings accordingly. This correction, along with industry-wide declining ad rates, has given publishers more modest earnings expectations after the first few years of unpredictable payouts. Jetpack 5.3 offers customers on the Premium and Professional plans more control over how ads are displayed.</p>\n<p>This release adds the ability for publishers to display multiple ads and introduces more control options for where they can be placed. Since WordAds pays based on the number of impressions (combined with many other factors) and not the number of clicks, selecting the right combination of placement options is important for success.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordads-jetpack5-3.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Other notable changes and improvements include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can preview their sites without leaving WordPress.com</li>\n<li>WordPress.com Toolbar updated to include link to comments</li>\n<li>Omnisearch feature was removed</li>\n<li>Improved performance in the admin by cutting back on unnecessary requests</li>\n<li>VideoPress shortcode includes option to stop video from looping during autoplay</li>\n<li>Fixed compatibility issues with plugins using TinyMCE</li>\n<li>Re-added a filter for Widget Visibility that was accidentally removed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a full list of all the changes included in Jetpack 5.3, check out the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/#developers\" target=\"_blank\">changelog</a> on WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 05:46:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids Attendees Share First Impressions of Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74538\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-attendees-share-first-impressions-of-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2688:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-grand-rapids.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>While attending <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> I had the opportunity to interview developers and business owners about their first impressions of the new Gutenberg editor. Many attendees I spoke to had not yet heard of the project but were intrigued and decided to install the plugin on a test site. A few attendees were developers who have already contributed to Gutenberg and are experimenting with extending the editor.</p>\n<p>Those who have tested the beta have varied concerns, depending on how they use WordPress in their professions. Some are waiting to begin testing until the plugin provides a more consistent experience. One of the most common concerns for developers is how the editor will handle meta boxes. Freelancers and agency owners are waiting to see how the new editor will affect their businesses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How much am I going to have to change what my company does as a business to build websites with this new tool?&#8221; Topher DeRosia asked.</p>\n<p>Agency owner Sara Dunn said she is excited about what Gutenberg will bring to WordPress and undaunted by the prospect of getting clients acquainted to a new interface. She believes the project has a lot of potential to solve some of the most common client frustrations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited about it, because I have a lot of clients who say they can&#8217;t stand WordPress because when they look at the backend and update their pages and posts, it doesn&#8217;t look how it looks on the frontend,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I really think WordPress needs this move to compete in the future, and I&#8217;m excited about where it&#8217;s going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John James Jacoby, one of the developers who has contributed to Gutenberg and experimented with extending it, said he considers it to be a very ambitious project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is probably one of the most important projects that anyone has worked on with WordPress in a number of years, in my opinion,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;My take on it is that everyone has the responsibility to try to influence the direction that it&#8217;s going to take. If we care about the open web and the freedom of how people publish to it, then we should all try to join in and help with its ongoing development and make it as good as it can be if it&#8217;s going to end up as part of WordPress in the coming months.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out the interviews below to see how attendees weighed in on Gutenberg.</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 05 Sep 2017 23:31:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: August 2017\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4899\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/the-month-in-wordpress-august-2017/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6420:\"<p>While there haven’t been any major events or big new developments in the WordPress world this past month, a lot of work has gone into developing a sustainable future for the project. Read on to find out more about this and other interesting news from around the WordPress world in August.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Global WordPress Translation Day Returns</h2>\n<p>On September 30, the WordPress Polyglots team will be holding <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">the third Global WordPress Translation Day</a>. This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/\">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/\">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/\">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/\">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy\">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/\">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/\">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">for testing</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/\">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/\">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/\">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/\">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/\">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/\">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href=\"https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac\">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/\">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span>If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\"><i><span>submit it here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Sep 2017 10:02:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Hugh Lashbrooke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids 2017 Sells Out, Organizers On Board for 2018 Event\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74039\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8631:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordcamp-grandrapids.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The 4th edition of <a href=\"http://2017.grandrapids.wordcamp.org\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> was held last weekend at Grand Valley State University’s downtown Pew Campus. After a brief hiatus following previous events in 2012, 2013, and 2014, the WordCamp is back in action with first-time lead organizer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mysweetcate\" target=\"_blank\">Cate DeRosia</a> at the helm.</p>\n<p>Tickets sold out shortly before the event and the vast majority of them were local to Michigan. DeRosia estimates that 40% came from Grand Rapids and 60% of attendees were within an hour radius. She published the camp&#8217;s details with a local events webpage and set up a Facebook page to increase local awareness. Organizers also received contacts from the WordPress dashboard events widget and the local MeetUp announcement.</p>\n<p>Despite being a relatively small WordCamp with 144 attendees, organizers had enough speaker submissions to fill three tracks with topics ranging from development and design to freelance best practices and scaling a business. Attendees characterized the organizers as &#8220;connectors&#8221; who have a natural gift for helping people and businesses get to know each other. DeRosia said one of the unique things about the lower Michigan WordPress community is its dedication to helping each other succeed with WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The core group in Grand Rapids, and really across the lower half of Michigan, is highly experienced and sincerely dedicated to helping people,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;No one is fighting to be top dog on the pile. No one&#8217;s gloating. Meetups and WordCamps are ways to give back, to encourage and grow others in the community. The focus is on the opportunities that WordPress can provide anyone and a willingness to share their years of hard earned experience to help others succeed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said the organizing team&#8217;s goal was to provide a little something for everyone and &#8220;an opportunity to learn what can be done and take that home to foster and grow at each individual&#8217;s own pace.&#8221; The event was marked by the friendliness and enthusiasm of the volunteers and provided several breaks and social times for attendees to exchange ideas and build relationships with others in the industry.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">4yrs ago I attended <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcgr?src=hash\">#wcgr</a> and knew no one.

DeRosia&#8217;s teenage daughter Sophia, who has been volunteering at camps for years, also joined by contributing the event&#8217;s wapuu design and helping with operations. In the short interview below she describes how she came up with the idea for the wapuu and why she enjoys getting involved in WordPress events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>DeRosia had just four months to get the event organized and said she relied heavily on information and resources from other WordCamp organizers in Michigan. She stayed with the same venue from previous camps, which she said met her criteria for making things convenient for attendees: lunch was easily available, parking was easy to find (and free), and it was within a reasonable walking distance of hotels and the after party. The camp had no issues getting local sponsorships.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our sponsors were amazing,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;We came in late to the schedule and still had the sponsorship we needed with out any problems. It helps that as an organizing group we&#8217;ve created friendships in the community, but most of our sponsorship was local or regional which really helped cement the idea that another WordCamp in the area has value.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said with the number of people who left talking about the next event, she anticipates there will be another WordCamp Grand Rapids in 2018 and she hopes to help again as lead organizer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew tackling the &#8216;unknowns&#8217; of this first one (and doing it in a short time frame) was going to be emotionally difficult for me personally, but I also realized that most of what I was planning for this year would simply be able to move over into next year,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;In a sense, I was planning much of the next camp while planning the first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a first-time organizer, DeRosia said she was impressed by the volunteers, speakers, and attendees&#8217; positive attitudes and their willingness to help given the short time frame.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Aside from being terrified of what I didn&#8217;t know, it was actually a very positive experience,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;I had tons of encouragement from our organizing team and the community at large. I was really able to build on the success of the first three Grand Rapids WordCamps, WordCamp Ann Arbor, and the newest area WordCamp in Jackson (MI). I had serious doubts that the community would even care about having another WordCamp (Was I just wasting my time?), but they proved that it&#8217;s a wanted commodity.&#8221;</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155129\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155129.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-sara\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-sara.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-br\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-br.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-jjj\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-jjj.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers2\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers2.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154730\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154730.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154854\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154854.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155040\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155040.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 21:08:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 1.0.0 Introduces Drag and Drop for Adding Image Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74447\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-0-0-introduces-drag-and-drop-for-adding-image-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3151:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 1.0.0</a> was released this week as another iteration in the beta period that will continue on with 1.1 next week.

This experience can be a bit jarring, but it may be inevitable unless more of the UI can be buried under the inspector. The paragraph blocks currently display the most commonly used controls for writing text content, but I could see plugins hooking into this to create different types of writing experiences that either add more controls or pare it back to something more minimalist.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:42:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: WordPress.org Now Allows Plugin Authors to Specify a Minimum PHP Version Requirement\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=74438\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-allows-plugin-authors-to-specify-a-minimum-php-version-requirement\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2585:\"<p>Although WordPress core currently maintains backwards compatibility with PHP 5.2.4+, plugin and theme authors are not required to do so. When developers include features that require more recent versions of PHP, it can break sites or cause otherwise unexpected behavior. As part of a larger effort to encourage users to upgrade their PHP versions, WordPress.org now allows plugin authors to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/\" target=\"_blank\">specify a minimum PHP version requirement</a> in the <code>readme.txt</code> file with a new Requires PHP header.

It also complements WordPress’ Core PHP team&#8217;s recent efforts to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-to-add-new-page-educating-users-on-benefits-of-upgrading-php\" target=\"_blank\">educate users about the benefits of upgrading PHP</a>, as the minimum supported version was released 10 years ago and hasn&#8217;t received security patches for nearly seven years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a plugin developer (who maintains my plugins in my spare time), it is becoming increasingly difficult to build new functionality that works in older versions of PHP,&#8221; Paul Gilzow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/#comment-43314\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the announcement. &#8220;There are some things that simply cannot be done in the older versions, and in those cases, I have to build out functionality to check PHP versions and disable those features. That takes time and energy away from building out other new features.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress Core Committer Sergey Biryukov said the next step is exploring the possibility of <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934\" target=\"_blank\">displaying a notice to users when they cannot install a theme or plugin</a> due to their installations not meeting the required criteria. Ideally, these notices would include host-specific instructions to assist users in getting their sites upgraded to a newer PHP version. This particular move could make a significant impact on the wider WordPress community, if popular plugins start triggering notices requiring newer versions of PHP.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 18:13:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"HeroPress: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2064\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:158:\"https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60068:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/083017-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: You can\'t always win.

I don’t know how this number &#8217;33&#8217; sounds to you, but in some ways, I feel it’s a big number. I know many of you would argue that 33 is not an age to be considered old. In this article I will share about my career with <strong>WordPress</strong> lasting over 13 years, and how I am planning to retire within a year, more or less. And if you are an <strong>Entrepreneur</strong> yourself or self-established person, I think this will be an intriguing discussion, I will add some key pointers from my life that lead me to this decision.</span></p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/edit_IMG_1358.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2067 size-large\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/edit_IMG_1358-1024x819.jpg\" alt=\"Me Enjoying the Sun & Jetpack Tees after a long drive to Key West!\" width=\"960\" height=\"768\" /></a>Me Enjoying the Sun &amp; Jetpack Tees after a long drive to Key West, FL!\n<h3><b>What do I mean by &#8216;retire&#8217;?</b></h3>\n<p><span>So, may be you are shocked to just see the title. The word ‘retire’ could be little confusing. Does that mean I am going to take leave from all of my ventures permanently? Will not be involved with anything day to day basis. And will be walking out in my beach-shorts in broad daylight, or vacationing endlessly anywhere in the world? </span></p>\n<p><span>In some sense, Yes, in some sense, No. The kind of office I have I could literally go in shorts though, and my life has given me the opportunity to vacation as I want, almost!</span></p>\n<p><span>But, yes, I am talking about taking leave from most of my ventures, at least not being involved day to day. And kind of taking a break to reflect more into life. I have been working tirelessly for a decade. I need some kind of breathing space, it&#8217;s not exactly what you think though. It’s kind of reboot. I will keep expanding the idea throughout the article. If you are really into, sadly you have to keep reading.</span></p>\n<h2><b>So, who am I?</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am not sure how boring this might get, but still, let me introduce myself.

As this article is entirely about me, you have to tolerate a lot more. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f600.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></span></p>\n<p><strong>This is going to be the biggest ever article published in HeroPress!</strong></p>\n<h2><b>So, I always wanted to do WordPress?</b></h2>\n<p><span>No, obviously not. In my childhood I always wanted to be <strong>a scientist, a Physicist</strong> to be exact. And it&#8217;s not just like an aim-in-life, I was literally very serious. I was always into Space Science. Later it grew more into Physics. To give you an idea how serious I was, let me tell you something. While going through some old boxes, I found out some paper-cutting from back in 1993(I was in 3rd Grade back then), about coverage of different space exploration, news about Pioneer, upcoming plan on a Probe in Saturn. I literally had a file to collect those. Back in that day, that&#8217;s what you could do most, without any internet, and from a remote part of <strong>Bangladesh</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>I was not extremely good in school, it&#8217;s not like what you read in the story, never stood 2nd type(always 1st)! It&#8217;s more like I never stood 1st type! But I was good in math, I was always progressing, and the main blessing I had in my life was support of my parents, unlikely most parents in our time, they never pushed me into things, never tried to push their judgment into my life. When I advanced from one Class to another, making some progress, they were happy with it, and I always made progress. So, they were happy, I was happy being a mediocre-student. But the issue was, in my mind, I was the best. I know how childish it sounds, but I was really a child back then! I always thought that I am best if I try enough, and if I was given enough opportunity. So, Instead of trying to do best in the Class, I focused on many things, like starting a Detective Company to Secret R&amp;D Team, and none of those was a joke, we were serious. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Reading!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I always loved reading, and I was extremely lucky to have so much opportunity to read in my childhood. My house has some collection of children’s book, some cheap but interesting translation, my parents always brought me books on every possible occasion, as that&#8217;s what would make me happy. When that was not enough, I practically sneaked into most houses in the neighborhood. I was in 7th Grade at that time, and if a neighbor had an older kid they would have more books, and good part was if you show interest in reading books, and return it carefully, they would not mind to open up their bookshelf door for you, and most of them even loved me for this. Later on, I also finished up most of my relatives collection in the same town. Later on when in high-school everyone around knew I love books. Later on, this grew on my friends as well. I was lucky to have good childhood friends, who also enjoyed books as well. So, we would gift books to each others birthday, so we could read it ourselves. And few of my friend was very good students, and they always got some scholarship money, so we spend everything in our school life on books!</span></p>\n<p><b>So, what was I was reading? Everything!</b></p>\n<p><b> &#8211; Everything!</b></p>\n<p><span>Starting from Children’s story later grew into Detective Story, Science Fiction, and later into the adventure story, literature, whatever comes into my hand. One interesting thing I also did from the very early stage, keeps track on what I am reading. It probably came from my hobby of collecting Stamps. We used to make notes and categorize our collection. So, I started doing the same for Books. I made a notebook, started noting and making a list of what I am reading, later on, I started to make some remarks, note, what I liked, what not. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Writing!</b></h2>\n<p><span>In my teenage life writing took even more meaning. I was always good at expressing myself, and creative writing. But when one of our best friends left the country, and the only way to communicate was to write letters, so, we started to do that. It took different turn very soon. We were enjoying writing letters so much, few of us in the same class who we see every day also started writing letters to each other. However, it was nothing like a love letter or anything related to the affair, we were writing about anything, everything. At one point we were in a competition who could write the longest letter. In this competition, one of my friends wrote a letter to me (again from the same class, sitting almost on my next desk! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f600.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> ) over 50 pages, and to defeat her I wrote an over <strong>100-page long letter</strong>! </span></p>\n<p><span>*If you are wondering what I wrote in those 100 pages &#8211; I have a very large family, where my relatives of great-great-grandfather’s cousin’s and their family are still very connected and if you saw me talking with any of them you would think they are my 1st Uncle or Aunt. So, what I did is wrote about my whole family tree, describing family history and later on describing each and every member I could remember! In my house we had a very old “Family Birth Register” (জন্ম কষ্টি খাতা), dating back in the early 1900s, I even took help from it!</span></p>\n<p>Over all this had a different impact on our life. I don&#8217;t know how hard it is to believe, but I was into Bangla Literature, specially poem as well, I even had a notebook full with my own poem! One of our classmates even wrote a full-blown 150+ pages novel in that age! And I am still enjoying writing!</p>\n<p><b>Dramatic changes in my Educational life!</b></p>\n<p><span>As described earlier, </span><span>I was average in studies</span><span> but not extremely good. And I was happy about it! All my </span><span>close friends were very good students and would achieve the first or second position in class every time. Whereas, I was happy being in the 8th or 10th position. But as said in my mind I was the best!</span></p>\n<p><span>Our educational system requires you to memorize and write as it is. But I was driven into reading books, and other things (also including playing Cricket seriously). I never tried to focus on memorizing anything. And from childhood, teachers grow an impression of what to expect from a particular student. So, for an example, my social science teacher knew for years what to expect from me, and it&#8217;s very hard to get past that impression. </span></p>\n<p><span>When I was advancing from Grade 8 to 9, I took part in a Scholarship exam. </span><span>We prepared for a year. Only a handful of us was participating from our school, I was among those few, but I had literally zero chance to get the scholarship. I was not very bothered about it at all. But during the exam, we had to travel to another town to the exam, and it was in the month of Ramadan, and I did not break my fast. It was hard, I had 2 exams in a single day. When I came back home one day with my father, my mom was sad seeing me so tired and drained out. But was happy that I was still fasting. Then she told me something very simply, which started a chain-reaction in my life. She told me, &#8220;You think of yourself so highly, you spend all of your time with those same kids, who are doing so good in school. But if you really think of yourself so highly, why not try to reflect that in your grade?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Maybe it&#8217;s very normal for parents to talk like that. But as my parents never compared me with anybody or always let me do in my way, I kept on thinking about this. </span><span>What clicked in my mind was that, i</span><span>f I am really good, I should be able to do good in any circumstances, if this requires me to memorize everything I could do that. If I want to be really that good, and be a good scientist, I need to learn to cope up and fight in any situation. </span></p>\n<p><b>So, I changed myself, was even memorizing books, that I absolutely did not like!</b></p>\n<p><span>In grade 9 &amp; 10, I studied very hard. I changed my lifestyle a lot. I changed the way I write in exam paper to change the impression of my teacher. Before I was always like studying in my mind, not writing what I just read, I forced myself in writing those answer I just read, it was very hard and boring at the beginning. But I had a very good private tutor, who guided me in every way. Later on my teachers in school helped in every way possible. In Bangladesh student have to take a part in a Certification Exam after 10th Grade, to advance in College, its called SSC, Secondary School Certificate Exam. I prepared for that. At the end of 10th Grade, I almost had the book fully memorized, I could write as it is, correct to each and every comma and space. I improved my english a lot. I learned some calculous which was not part of our curriculum, just to advance myself for college, and I knew if I had to do better in Physics I need to learn math and Calculous better. I did took part in more Prep test than most other students. And ultimately in the School Preparation Exam, I did extremely well to boost up my energy!</span></p>\n<p><span>Everything was perfect, we took part in the big exam!</span></p>\n<p><b>And I did not get the grade I expected!</b></p>\n<p><span>Interestingly our batch did not get good grades in SSC</span><span>, we were the first batch in a new grading system, and we did not know that even before the exam, so none got perfect grade of 5.0, I got a very average grade(not bad, but not very good either). I was extremely disappointed, broken, but later learned to cope up.</span><span> I realized a good lesson of life that </span><b>&#8211; Even though you may work hard and go to great lengths to do everything possible, still you might have to deal with failures and disappointments.</b></p>\n<p><span>Another good thing also happened in my life too. I moved from the small town I grew up, <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishwardi_Upazila\">Ishurdi</a></strong>, to the Capitol of the Nation, <strong>Dhaka</strong>, and was able to get a chance in the entrance exam, of all big colleges in the country where I tried. This gave me a huge boost in confidence. I selected to study in <strong>Notre Dame College</strong>, in English Medium of Science. It was another controversial decision I made, for me a kid coming from rather a small town, and from Bangla Medium it was a tough decision, but I stick to it for the future, because I still wanted to be a Physicist, wanted to study further in my life, I knew I had to be in English Medium.</span></p>\n<p><b>I had very hard time at the beginning of College!</b></p>\n<p><span>At the start it was very hard, our whole group suffered a lot to cope up with new curriculum, our first semester in College was the worst. But later we learned to cope up, we were 130 students in our Group (famous Group 8 in Notre Dame College), we all were helpful to each other, not everyone had private teacher in this point, we shared our notes, I was living first time without my parents, I was also dealing with occasional sickness due to not eating properly. So, there was a lot of struggle, but by the end of 1st year, I was dealing with everything properly. I got a good friend circle, I was not only doing well in college, I was also enjoying my freedom and mostly dealing with anything life throws at me!</span></p>\n<h2><b>My Introduction to Computer &amp; Programming!</b></h2>\n<p><span>Actually, I always loved programming, before entering University I already knew some basic programming, like qBasic, FORTRAN, even some level of Pascal. The kind of society I grew up, a computer was extremely rare before the year 2000. I was kind of lucky to be able to learn basic computer usage starting from the year 1998, got my first computer in 1999. It was so rare to own a computer in that time for that part of the word, that I was not only the first kid in my class to own a computer, but only a handful of people in my town knew how to use a computer. So, though I am not from a very rich or privileged family, extremely lucky that my parents understood the importance in that time. </span></p>\n<p><span>Another interesting aspect was unlike most people, I was not fully taken over by Computer Games. I am not saying gaming is bad, but most of the people I later see own a computer, the main thing they do with it was playing the game all the time. And you have to understand that almost pre-internet period in Bangladesh. I use the internet first in my life back in 2001. I was more into tweaking things, trying to create or modify the software or create very basic type tools. I am super amazed by internet from first interaction. The search engine was in its peak time, discovering new resource was easy. I tried creating my first webpage in Yahoo Geocities back in 2001, wap page generator was also taking shape in coming years. </span></p>\n<p><b>Say Hi to WordPress in my life!</b></p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Asif-R1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2068 size-large\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Asif-R1-1024x863.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"809\" /></a>M Asif Rahman &#8211; Wearing Tees by WordPressian Group!\n<p><span>      I created my first blog back in 2003 in Blogger, but while trying to add a sidebar and customizing home page look, I find it&#8217;s very difficult for me to do anything in ASP.net, then I found WordPress, back in the year 2004. I still remember reading Matt’s blog and write up about how the whole project is moving ahead from b2 cafelog. WordPress was so easy, I hardly knew any PHP in that time, but my HTML and CSS knowledge was well enough for me being able to edit my personal blog. At the start hosting was one issue, but again I was lucky to manage one. Later when WordPress.com came, I migrated my blog over there and was happy at the beginning, as less hassle. I was also heavily involved with forum community. There was some very large community for webmaster and developer, I loved PHPbb and other solution for forums as well. But after experiencing some massive vulnerabilities, which lead to a major data breach, I focused more on personal blogging and soon into web development. Wth WordPress it was extremely easy to create a website, plugin and theming turn out to be not a complex task. The community and developers contributing in this ecosystem were another main factors. I feel very connected with the whole ecosystem, eventually became habituated with this, and started to feel it&#8217;s my comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p><b>How I started my career and company!</b></p>\n<p><span>I was using the name A. R. Communication, an as an acronym of my initials (Asif Rahman) back in 2001 as well, but it was nothing serious, no particular business. When in college, to support myself I first started a Marketing Trainee job in a Multi-international company. It was convenient with my college time and location, and they were literally paying to learn things. I started it just the as need of money, but later I enjoyed marketing, corporate training, and even enjoyed sales training as well. But I never took that job a as career choice.</span></p>\n<h3><b>My first venture!</b></h3>\n<p><span>In the year 2003, before even going to Universities I started a full 4 color magazine, printed publication with a close friend of mine. It was a fun ride. The name of the magazine was “</span><b>Fortnightly Tumi</b><span>”, the Bangla word “Tumi” means “</span><b>You</b><span>”! It was a lifestyle Magazine. My family already had a history with the printing business, so I had some experience. We did this business very thoroughly if you consider this as our first venture. We did a proper market study, interviewed potential readers, organized group discussion, and got good funding. And we also started with bang! Hired renowned journalist and writer. I was barely <strong>19 years old</strong> that time, have very experienced people in my team over 50 years old, and managing them was good lesson. All together we published 3 edition, with good marketing trick we were able to sell 10,000 copy nationwide for that last edition, we had over 20 big brands in the country advertising with us. But still, that business did not work out. We had to shut down, as our investor (my friend’s family) want us to focus on our education instead of this, and we were probably way ahead of our time.</span></p>\n<p><b>Too many choices after college!</b></p>\n<p><span>I did fairly good in college, despite being in English medium. I applied for the various scholarship in different university all around the world, and was in a process of ISSB for Airforce as GD Pilot, the whole process was lengthy, and I was only doing it for 2 reasons.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>One of my friends asked me to collect the form, as it was close from my house, and I thought why not fill up together.</span></li>\n<li><span>GD Pilots also get the chance of studying Aeronautical Engineering and even switch to Engineering in future, and they will have a chance to study higher in that subject, which could open up my door for getting into Space Science. All for free, paid by Govt.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Interestingly I get past all the test and selected finally. But they informed me, I have to stay in GD Pilot as a cadet and will be commissioned in 2 years, but have to think Pilot as a career, I was confused, I never enjoyed or felt the passion for speed before in my life. And we had few months time before joining the Force.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the meantime, I got so many opportunities in various universities. And one of my dream to study further in Physics was too close, as I got a chance in Uni Penn, and got a scholarship there as well. I had few other opportunities at Canada and Australia. I even applied for Visa for Australia as well, but later had to decide against all of those for some family and personal reason. </span></p>\n<p><span>I ultimately left Air Force as well, me &amp; my parents agree that&#8217;sts not a good career choice for me, given the option I had. I got a scholarship at North South University in Electrical &amp; Telecommunications Engineering. And as I started my company seriously at beginning of 2004, then a University that offers Open Credit, where I am able to choose my workload, it was just convenient. So, out of all promising option, I almost chose the risky one, to make my own company and study in Bangladesh, at least for the Bachelor.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The inception of ARCom:</b></h2>\n<p><span>Actually, ARCom is the short version of A. R. Communications. As I found making website too easy with WordPress, and a new found talent was helping me as well. </span></p>\n<p><span>Just as I never waste time on gaming, rather enjoyed my time to tweak things, creating new application. Instead of most people, when they visit a new website, they look at the shiny look, or how good or better information it provides, whenever I visit a good site, I was always thinking how they are making money, how is this built and sustained. This quest has helped me making our first successful business. It took years, it did not turn into something very big in a night. During University years I did make many different kinds of websites, in that time I started earning first from selling websites. That was during the year 2005 or 2006, it was long before Sitepoint turn into Flippa, back in the shining days of DigitalPoint! I used that money to buy more domain. I hired my university classmate to work with me. The first outsider I hired in my company was a designer, as I needed help in there. Later it kept growing over the year.</span></p>\n<h3><b>First Big Success:</b></h3>\n<p><span>Though I already enjoyed some good (if not very big) payday by selling a website, point to note here, I was selling website as a business, not like you design a site and sell, its more about creating a business, create a process and sell it for a 2X &#8211; 5X yearly profit. But my big success came after 2008. Everything was turning so well, I was done with my University. My company was already a Team of over 20 people, with an office of 2500 square feet space. We started </span><a href=\"https://thetechjournal.com\"><b>The Tech Journal</b></a><span>, it worked so well in every aspect. As I was into writing blogs and also into the gadget. After the first iPhone release I was involved in many ways, from working with the secret group who were Jailbreaking each and every firmware, also new kind of responsive websites, I was also into News &amp; those kinds of stuff. And because of my quest to understand how a thing works, I had a good grasp already into Content Distribution. Facebook and other Social Media are playing a role in content and distribution already. It all helped.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Tech Journal became very big!</b></p>\n<p><span>Within 6 months of start, we ranked within top 20k website. I was enjoying the ride to play with monetization and taking things into next phase. At one pick point, we were ranked even within top 4000 websites in Alexa. I had a good team with me. I finished my university already, 3 of my University friend was working with me full time. We all shared same vision for The Tech Journal, and it kept on growing. Because of our experience with WordPress we kept on innovating, for us we could build anything in WordPress, I had a solid Development team as well.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Marriage &amp; Beyond!</b></h3>\n<p><span>I got married at 2009, I was 25 years old back then. I don’t know if there is any perfect age for marriage, but I felt that was the right time, I was doing good in business, was looking for more stability in emotional life as well. I suddenly found my long lost childhood friend, <strong>Bipasha</strong>, whom I did not have any communication for past 13 years, but suddenly fall in love and we decide to get married. <strong>Just like that!</strong> I will not go into details here(it&#8217;s already too big) how we studied together since 1st grade and got detached when we were in 7th Grade, but still got married 13 years later. We started a new life, life was never better!</span></p>\n<p><b>Moving Further with WordPress:</b></p>\n<p><span>Over the year WordPress kept growing so was I. I was writing, blogging, building things with WordPress. WordCamp was already something, but I was not able to attend or participate as I was still in Universities, but after finishing up, I decide to get more involved. I spoke in my first WordCamp in WordCamp Melbourne. For many years I was also very vocal about security and optimization, so I started to get so many opportunities into speaking and participating in various things. I still remember I spent one crazy summer in the US, participating 6 WordCamps, visiting 9 States and 13 cities in the process, starting from Boston and finishing at San Francisco! </span></p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asif-Speaking-At-WordCamp-SF-2014-V1.1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2069\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asif-Speaking-At-WordCamp-SF-2014-V1.1-1024x514.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"482\" /></a>WordCamp SF 2014 &#8211; Mission Bay Conference Center\n<p><span>I was very lucky to be able to speak at last ever WordCamp San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pursuing more into Investment!</b></p>\n<p><span>It&#8217;s mainly because of <strong>The Tech Journal</strong>, I was involved in many tech conferences, and always getting the pitch from various startups. And my new grown circle of friends from WordPress and various other tech scenes, I already established a good connection in Silicon Valley. It was in the year 2009 when I made my first Angel investment, the credit must go to my friend circle, it was years before Angel List, there was offline syndicate where folks will share investment opportunity. But I really loved talking with young entrepreneur and seeing how new business works. I kept my focus in my sector, the field I understand. So, I mainly invested in tech. Out of several investments, one of my lucky ones was Facebook, I was able to invest in <strong>Facebook</strong> before their IPO, not very early, but still Pre-IPO stage, it was one of my lucky breaks. As I was already doing good in my business I tried to utilize it. I did not start investing because I had too much cash laying around, I started because I liked those opportunities, I wanted to help those ideas or startups.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Moving into the US:</b></h2>\n<p><span>I started another business in US, where my partner was from Orlando, I spent one Thanksgiving with my Wife in Orlando, really loved the place, people, and we already got a long term Visa, and had full opportunity to live anywhere we want. My company in Bangladesh was already in a stable phase, and as I was traveling heavily for years, my team was used to being managed remotely, so it was not a hard decision. But staying far from parents was hard. So, what we started maintaining both houses in Bangladesh and Florida. For years we spend some part of the year in US, rest in Bangladesh. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Child &amp; Changes in Life!</b></h3>\n<p><span>Like everybody else our life was bound to change when we had baby. In year 2014 we were getting for our first baby. We decide to stay in US, because of better medical facility and my involvement in different things. Just a month after speaking at WordCamp San Francisco in November we were blessed with <strong>Aaniyah</strong>. Actually, our life already changed when we were planning and waiting for the baby. I was feeling the work routine I have would never let me spend the time I want to have with my baby.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Laugh.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2070\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Laugh-1024x691.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"648\" /></a></p>\n<h2><b>Analytify &amp; A New friendship!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I became friends with </span><a href=\"http://www.adnan.pk/\"><span>Muhammad Adnan</span></a><span> online back in 2014, he was working with his premium Plugin <a href=\"https://analytify.io/\"><strong>Analytify</strong></a> back then. I found this as a real good project and started talking with him, giving him various advice, and we later decided to team up, and we released the first free version of Analytify WordPress plugin on 1st January 2015. It was a success, it completely revolutionizes how people use Google Analytics in WordPress. Later Adnan visited me in the US in 2015, and together we attended WordCamp Miami and had a good trip and drive to Key West! The most interesting part of the friendship lies somewhere else. I am a Bangladeshi, and Adnan is Pakistani. Both of our nation has a very bad past. Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan, back in 1971 we fought for about 9 months, and millions of people died in the process before we got Freedom and Declared Independence from Pakistan. But it creates a life long enmity between two countries. I know for an outsider it does not make sense to keep some feelings for that long, but for its very personal for us. Our country lost so much in that war, even if you speak about just my family, My Grandmother lost half of her family in that war, Bangladeshi especially have a very strong opinion about any Pakistani. But meeting Adnan, becoming friends, and working together made me realize few interesting thing, this feeling, this agony against any Pakistani was one-way. Most of the Pakistani did not have any idea what their Government or Army did, they hardly have idea about their Ancestors’ doing. They rather still consider us Brother! Some of the history he never knew, they never read in their history book. I would never know this if it&#8217;s not for </span><b>WordPress</b><span>, we would never meet, this change in understanding for both of us never happened.</span></p>\n<p><span>And we together kept on growing <strong>Analytify</strong>, as the best Google Analytics Plugin in WordPress, and planning many interesting things together.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Coming Back to Bangladesh!</b></h2>\n<p><span>While I was staying and mostly investing in the US, I started investing in some interesting Teams in Bangladesh from the year 2012. Over the year, a few failed, but some really kept on growing. In the year 2016, in Pre-Trump period we were expecting our 2nd Baby, and it was too hard for us to manage alone in the US, and we both were missing our family. I want my kids to grow up having their family close to them, the way I grew up. I want my parents to feel close to them. Occasionally when we visited Bangladesh with our first child, I was quite blown away the way they loved and took care of the baby. It all made sense if we spend some more time in Bangladesh, and have the Baby in here. And the weird things going on with the US also motivated my decision. The kind of craziness we are seeing in the US, actually did not start just by having Trump elected. It goes way back. We were living in a  very peaceful neighborhood in Florida, a small town called Orange City, near Daytona Beach! But we could still feel the change in air. Our parents have a pending Immigration Application for near a decade, they are on the que to become US citizen anyway. We first tried to have them with us, but US Embassy in Bangladesh rejected that application, for absolutely no reason. And my other venture was already growing in Bangladesh. So, all together we decide to stay in Bangladesh for awhile, we moved in mid-2016.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Welcoming Aadiyah into the Family!</b></h3>\n<p><span>We had our 2nd Baby <strong>Aadiyah</strong> in September 2016, a bit ahead of time, my wife got little too sick, but we were able to handle everything because of having family together. We moved into a large Duplex house, to have enough space for the baby. We feel we are complete as family and never been this happy before.</span></p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1610.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2071\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1610-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /></a>Complete Family!\n<h1><b>weDevs &amp; My Legacy!</b></h1>\n<p><span>I will discuss later my involvement in Bangladeshi WordPress Eco-system. But back in 2013 I first met <a href=\"https://tareq.co/\">Tareq</a>, a very talented Bangladeshi Programmer, running a successful WordPress product company. He and his Partner <strong>Nizam</strong> built an amazing company, and they had few very interesting and super successful products for WordPress. I started helping as possible from my end, I want them to succeed and pushing them to move forward. I became an official partner and board member of <a href=\"https://wedevs.com\"><strong>weDevs</strong></a> back in 2015. I was helping them to grow internationally and advising them as part of the board. We established a US company and kept on growing. Though I was in WordPress for very long time, my main company <strong>ARCom</strong> was never serious into WordPress Product. I released some of <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/asif2bd\">our work</a> in Open Source via WordPress.org Plugin Directory, and with my growing experience with <strong>Analytify</strong> made me dig more into WordPress products.</span></p>\n<p><span>Somehow at the end of 2016, <strong>Tareq</strong> and I was looking at our numbers for <strong>weDevs</strong> in 2016, we noticed something very important. Three of us spend more time digging deep into the numbers and re-analyzed our process and priorities. Soon we all came into understanding we have to take things forward with <strong>weDevs</strong>, the growth of the industry is very important if we want to be big in future this is the right time. They proposed to me if I could take over as <strong>CEO</strong>. Nizam was running weDevs successfully as CEO for years, and I never thought seriously about running another company, and my retirement plan was already in place. But we found this could be the best thing we could do in the year 2017, where I have little over 1.5 years before my planned retirement. </span></p>\n<p><span>So, I jumped into the ship. I always dreamed to make a rocking and successful company in WordPress product space, and it was my chance. And as it&#8217;s already a running successful company, my goal here to build a legacy, instead of just making a profitable company, built a sustainable company, and proper team, a fine management, that could grow into future, that could </span><b>outgrow us</b><span>, something even bigger than us combined. </span></p>\n<a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5190R.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2073 size-large\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5190R-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /></a>weDevs new office &#8211; Reception Area from inside &#8211; WordPress Flavoured!\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>So, I took over <strong>weDevs of CEO</strong> in January 2017, I took 2 months as the transition period and blend fully into the day to day system. We announced this officially in the month of March. Dhaka is a very jam packed city with the highest number of people living in per square miles in the world. We were already a Team of about 25 people. I still had few other business that I have to take care. So, we moved to a new large space. A total of 5000 square feet space, fully open, we built a unique office that could sustain us for next few year. I moved my house and office in the same area, called <strong>Mirpur DOHS</strong>. Me, my partners, and almost 12 of us together moved into this area together. As we now live within 2 min distance from the office, the Traffic could not bother us at all. We gave the option for our employees to move into too. We paid the moving cost, we even adjusted salary if they faced any increase of cost for housing or anything. We took time, but now our new office is complete, it&#8217;s one very interesting WordPress themed workplace.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5240R.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2074\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5240R-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>We are growing further, our team of 25 people will soon <strong>become a team of  50+</strong>. We are working on new stunning products, we just launched a brand new super fast Form Builder plugin named <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/weforms/\"><strong>weForms</strong></a>. It will revolutionize the way people build forms and create anything from just a simple contact form to organize a quiz. Our team built it entirely on Vue.JS, as a single page app. It&#8217;s unbelievably fast, almost nothing we have seen so far inside WordPress.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our Team internally working very hard to update our existing product and we are working on some new things that I am incredibly looking forward to. Before I join, weDevs did not have a marketing team, we ran entirely autonomous. In last 6 months, we have built a sustainable Content &amp; Marketing Team. I am working tirelessly with my CTO &amp; COO to build a new culture. We have a two-way feedback evaluation process. I created a kind of unique in its way, a grading system where the company could give feedback to an employee, on exact point, and inform directly where they need to improve. It&#8217;s a kind of algorithm I have developed over the years and really helps you to make a happy and working team. In the same way, Employee also have the opportunity to give feedback to the company directly &#8211; about what makes them happy, how a company could help him grow more, or if the company is addressing every concern properly. We do this quarterly basis, and review in each quarter, so the improvement could always be tracked, graphed and addressed properly.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Bangladeshi WordPress Community!</b></h2>\n<p><span>This is another very proud thing I would like to talk about. When I first had a very detail conversation with Matt Mullenweg, back in 2011, he was very happy that I attending so many WordCamp, and be that much involved with the community, he asked me about WP community back my country, and told me if we are able to have a good group, a nice meetup and eventually a WordCamp, he will try to attend. I found a new role for myself, over the year we grew Bangladeshi WordPress community. Locally we have very growing and engaging WordPress Group, called WordPressians, we have over 21,000 Members in Facebook. We are a team of 15 Admin/Organizer who maintains everything, and it&#8217;s an open group so always evolving. Over the year, we 15 became very close to each other, and we all consider each other as best friend. We contribute in Open Source together, we hangout together, attend various WordCamps around together now, we plan day out together as well. This is another blessing happened to our life mainly because of WordPress.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9881.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2075\" src=\"http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9881-1024x417.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"391\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Starting from 2013 we are official meetup chapter in Dhaka. We organized over 15 meetup, where each and every meetup of our could be considered little WordCamp, with 4-6 session, and had 150-300 attendees. We organized all of our meetup in our own platform, a WordPress plugin we created, so everything happened at &#8211; WPressians.net, not at Meetup.com, we did it with direct permission from WordPress Foundation. We have made WordCamp Application starting from 2013. And I even faced Organizer interview twice in 2014.</span></p>\n<h3><b>But the sadness!</b></h3>\n<p><span>There is one thing that hurt me a lot. Though me and our organizing team worked so hard to grow Bangladeshi WordPress community, but due to some miscommunication, we still don&#8217;t have any WordCamp yet. The foundation failed to take timely measures to proceed with our WordCamp application, we faced repeated issues in getting the proper timely response from them. Out of frustration and years of waiting back in 2015, we organized a CMS Conference in Dhaka, where we had over 10 speakers, and there were over 1500 attendees. So our team has proven their position, but things took so long from the Foundation. I wrote to foundation much time, there is one on-going conversation, still, we hope for the best, this the way Foundation handled our communication, shows the lack-of-attention clearly. I am almost devastated in this and very hurt! When I first attended and spoke in WordCamp Melbourne in 2011, I was the first Bangladeshi to ever do so. I but I kept on pushing. Now there is over 10 from even just our organizing team where they attended in various <strong>WordCamps around the World</strong>. Last year we attended WordCamp Singapore with a team of 9 people from Bangladesh. We are gaining experience, we are driven, but still lacking behind because of Foundation, sadly! I attended over <strong>50 WordCamps</strong> worldwide, I helped to organize over 10 WordCamps in various cities, but could not organize a single one in my home country for 6 years, this keeps bugging me all the time!</span></p>\n<h1><b>My Future Plan!</b></h1>\n<h2><b>Plan to retire by my next Birthday!</b></h2>\n<h3><b>weDevs to keep on Growing!</b></h3>\n<p><span>I am here at weDevs to create and fine tune the process and build the vision. I already described what&#8217;s happening in there. From my start as CEO we are seeing about 15% month to month growth in revenue and about 20% in market reach, We will keep on doing so and beyond. And we will probably get more result in long term, and building team, forming up a new culture and getting result certainly take more than 6 months.</span></p>\n<p><span>So far the plan is to me stay in Day to Day involve up until June 2018. This is not an exact day plan, could change with time. But possibly by September!</span></p>\n<h2><b>ARCom being Autonomous!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am running ARCom without much of daily maintenance for awhile now. I have Team Lead, Editors, Managers in place, that&#8217;s running their wing successfully for awhile now. There are few new plans and things my Team working, but all team has a lead, which they ran with ownership, and mostly sustainable. There are some places where we need some work, I hope it will be done by that projected time.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Geeky Social, 3rdBell and my other venture!</b></h2>\n<p><b>Geeky Social</b><span> has a solid team, and they are running amazingly. I am very proud of our team. I am part of the board and now serving as Chairman, and probably will continue to do so. I hope by next 6-9 months we will be even stronger financially, our month to month growth is already steady and growing, we are clear it will grow a lot from there. One of our core success is to grow beyond a cash-hungry business, which is incredibly hard if you are involved in Digital Media, and buying. But we got past that and now everything taking shape. I am very confident in the team and looking forward.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://3rdbell.co\"><b>3rdBell</b></a><span> faced so much issues over the year, but now we have a solid platform, the founders are incredibly motivated. Me and other investors are looking forward. I am still involved as Technical Director, this role could extend for the time being when we go through some changes, but we have solid plan to move forward, and by mid-next year, it should be i a  different height.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Me &amp; WordPress &#8211; going forward! </b></h2>\n<p><span>I will have people to maintain my plugin, and provide even better support, and few of them are even joining next month, so it will be well taken care of. I will shift the community role mostly to new people and others. Next 9 months I will dedicate to have more Contributor from my community and circle. I will literally incubate contributor,  from Core contribution to Docs and Community team. I will drive more into sharing my experience and finding over the decade. Besides writing, which I think is my superpower(!), but still under used, I will drive more into Speaking. Those are my next upcoming  Session, if you are happened to any of those WordCamp, please say Hi!</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>WordCamp Colombo, Sri Lanka &#8211; 23rd September</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Topic &#8211;</b><a href=\"https://2017.colombo.wordcamp.org/speaker/m-asif-rahman/\"><span> Making Million in WordPress Plugin But Not Being Evil!</span></a></p>\n<p><span>      2)  <strong>WordCamp Ahmedabad, India &#8211; 7th October</strong></span></p>\n<p><b>Topic &#8211;</b> <a href=\"https://2017.ahmedabad.wordcamp.org/\"><span>You heard content is the king, but are you paying attention to Content Distribution?</span></a></p>\n<p><span>If you read so far, you should understand how relevant both topic to my life! </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>How could I financially sustain this?</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am thinking, planning and working on this retirement plan for awhile now. The main question I got asked how could I financially sustain. I don’t know what kind of impression you have got so far by reading about my life. Yes, I own several successful ventures, running a very growing and profitable business, I also invested in the 20+ venture and was extremely lucky to enjoy some exit from the investment. But not in very big scale. Some of my investment looks promising, but that does not make me very rich in cash. So this plan further is not about having tons of cash in hand laying around, it&#8217;s more about having sustainable and ongoing earning. I do certainly have some exit I am looking forward to but my plan will not depend on it. I am confident now I could easily go beyond this month-to-month type calculation! </span></p>\n<h2><b>The Hardest Part!</b></h2>\n<p><span>When you grow business for over a decade, the main challenges are people. Like some successful venture, I also have businesses that are not cash-positive but has people involved with it for years. When you run a business, you become responsible for those people, their family depends on your decision, that type of responsibilities will limit you sometimes taking logical business decision. And really relying so much into people, and the fear of let going control could be hard dilemma any Entrepreneur could feel. </span></p>\n<p><span>But over the year I learned,<strong> sometimes you have to let go to get things done for future, sometimes you have to take a leap of faith</strong>. So, I practiced that for some time now. I am positive that things will work out, and won&#8217;t break apart.</span></p>\n<h1><b>Reason: Why I am doing this?</b></h1>\n<p><span>In some ways I feel I am doing this for very long time. I have built team, product, faced hard time, and also enjoyed when things work out, I have gone through this circle so many times. There is always hard time and I have seen how it all ultimately always worked out. I kind of want to get out of this circle. Sometimes I feel tired. Though for a person like me who single handily started everything, broke so many barriers, it&#8217;s hard to get me tensed. I know how to deal with pressure, hard time, shitty situation. In some ways I am resistant to those. But when I reflect everything in my life I am very proud what I have done, what I have Achieved.</span></p>\n<p><b>Monetary wealth did not make me rich! </b><span>But the experience and relation that I cultivated did. I feel rich because of this. </span></p>\n<p><span>When I was still a teenager, dreaming to be a physicist, I had a very thorough vision of my future, I wanted to finish my PhD by age 25. Later in the course of life I became Entrepreneur. Then my goal was to become a millionaire  by age 25 and have a stable family. I was successful in that. I have the vision to built amazing WordPress team and product, I am doing that right now. </span></p>\n<p><b>I want to move on, I would like to see greater meaning of life. </b><span>That does not mean what I am doing is great, it&#8217;s just going beyond. I always thought life has a bigger meaning for me, I always felt privileged, the kind of life I had, most people from my demography could not have, so I have bigger responsibilities! </span></p>\n<h2><b>How &#8216;Big&#8217; is WordPress?</b></h2>\n<p><span>WordPress is biggest CMS and No.1 solution to make Website, but how many businesses do you see worth over a $100M in WordPress Ecosystem? Or over $50M? Not much. And because of so much recent #WPDrama, one thing is very clear, we have a long way to grow. I kind of feel to make it too big, we even limited ourself as well. I do see the power struggle inside the community as well. The most respected person in the community, now have very large number of haters, and for few semi-valid reasons.<strong> That is sad, maybe we all need to rethink!</strong></span></p>\n<h1><b>What will I do in future?</b></h1>\n<p>Maybe I will <strong>drive deep into science</strong>, I will be still 34, even enough time to study something new! <span>Maybe I will just enjoy the break for awhile. Maybe I will try to find the better meaning of life. Or maybe will write a book, I don’t know, I want to keep the option open, have an open heart. I do certainly earn this freedom myself, I am very grateful to the list of endless great people that helped me throughout the decade of my career.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Your kids to reflect You!</b></h2>\n<p><span>We all want our kids to be like us, we want them to reflect us in a good way, and go beyond. But If we are not involved in every process of their life how could this happen? If you let your family, mainly wife to entirely take care of your kid how they are going to learn from you? Do you really believe just giving 1-2 hours a day will do the trick? It&#8217;s way more than that. I want to be an integral part of my kids’ life. I want to be fully involved in their process of growing up. In this whole thing, there is nothing related of deciding fate of their life. I have no expectation of making my kids something, I am fully open, they will decide their destiny, their own venture. I just want to help them understand this World, </span><b>be their Dad</b><span>, be the friend they could play with, be the teacher they need, as long as they need.</span></p>\n<p><span>I will spend more time with my family, my 2 young daughters really need more of me, they will be 4 &amp; 2 by next year. They will go into school, perfect time for me to jump in.</span></p>\n<h1><strong>Conclusion: For You!</strong></h1>\n<p>If you came this far reading this, you could probably tell I enjoyed writing! My routine hardly gives me more option to do it regularly. I was meant to write this HeroPress article last year but was too busy, and the timing was too near of the 2nd baby&#8217;s birth!</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect others to try to retire early, but having a choice in life is important. Try to look back. Why do you work? Is it because of earning money? Just to survive, just to sustain your family? This should not be the purpose of human life. I believe our Creator created us for a reason, <strong>we are not meant to live and die selfishly like an animal. There should be more meaning of life other than trying to buy luxury!</strong></p>\n<p>There is a Ted talk describing Humans, how evaluated to be Human, one of the core reason was we cooked, and gathered and stored food, so we spent less time like other Gorillas to try to find food and spend most of the days for that purpose. We cooked, it was easy to chew, and it gave us more free time, so we were able to innovate! Interesting theory, but surely intriguing.</p>\n<p><strong>Life is not always about achieving it all. It&#8217;s sometimes about the journey. You can&#8217;t always win. You have to learn from the journey and move on.</strong></p>\n<p>When I look back I do see, my decision to invest worked out many ways. <strong>As I diversified my venture it was a good move.</strong> I made many mistakes and described in details here as well, but I tried to learn and reflect that in my further life. I am who I am, because of the journey. I don&#8217;t regret any part of it. If I had the chance would I have done it differently? I don&#8217;t know, maybe that could be a different journey. My life is wrapped up entirely with WordPress, I am and will always be proud of that. But maybe I need to give myself a fair chance to see the world clearly. For past 13-14 years, I have worked every day on an average 14 hours of more, I still stay at the office for over 12 hours. But I don&#8217;t do it because I have to, I do it because I enjoy it. But this is taking too much of my life, I am too swamped up. This break is necessary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I really like to thank Topher &amp; HeroPress for giving me this opportunity and pushing me on writing this. I was very confused as it turns out this BIG. I thought it was just 2500-3000 words, I wrote almost on the fly, so was not looking at word count. Probably this is kind of my thing, if an idea is clear in my head, I don&#8217;t have issues putting it into letters.</em></p>\n<p><em>Topher told me this is twice the size of the previous longest essay in HeroPress. <strong>I am glad if you read it completely! That&#8217;s also an achievement!</strong> Then why not spent few second more to say Hi in the comments, so I could know who read this far!</em></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Retiring%20Young%20From%20Bangladesh%2C%20Thanks%20To%20WordPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F&title=Retiring+Young+From+Bangladesh%2C+Thanks+To+WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/083017-150x150.jpg&description=Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/\" title=\"Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/\">Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 00:00:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"M Asif Rahman\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Akismet: Akismet and Drupal, Together Again\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1960\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2017/08/29/akismet-and-drupal-together-again/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1569:\"<p>Akismet is used on millions of WordPress sites, but it isn&#8217;t only used with WordPress.

We have challenges (user frustrations with publishing and customizing, competition from site builders like Squarespace and Wix) and opportunities (the 157 million small businesses without sites, aka the next big market we should be serving). It’s time for WordPress’ next big thing, the thing that helps us deal with our challenges and opportunities. The thing that changes the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Automattic has been moving towards offering better support for small businesses with its 2015 <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce\" target=\"_blank\">acquisition of WooCommerce</a> and steady commercialization of Jetpack, with plans targeted at business owners. The company is poised to capture even more of the self-hosted small business market by allowing customers to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-business-plan-gives-subscribers-a-way-to-tap-into-wordpress-orgs-third-party-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">tap into WordPress&#8217; third-party ecosystem</a>.</p>\n<p>However, many vocal opponents to Gutenberg (and the changes that will come along with it) are concerned that the project is being developed chiefly to serve Automattic&#8217;s customers and corporate interests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg has been mainly introduced by one particular company which seems to be in urgent need to compete with other SaaS businesses,&#8221; WordPress theme development company owner <a href=\"https://www.mhthemes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Hebenstreit</a> said. &#8220;That’s fine, but then keep it as a plugin for at least 1-2 years, put it on WordPress.com (to gather real live feedback and usage data) and nobody will have any issues with that approach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg addressed concerns that Gutenberg is being developed for Automattic&#8217;s customers in a <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587598\" target=\"_blank\">reply</a> to a similar comment on his post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There definitely is a contingent that seems to think that, but if you think through it logically it doesn’t make sense: if it were just to benefit Automattic it would be far easier and more advantageous to just do Gutenberg unilaterally in Calypso, where it would primarily benefit WordPress.com,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Doing it in wp-admin and core first involves a lot more discussion, public feedback, backwards compatibility concerns, and breaking a lot of new ground for how core uses Javascript, and because it’s in core the benefits will accrue to all hosts of WordPress, many of which directly or indirectly compete with Automattic. We are reading and trying to learn from all the negative feedback though, even when it’s from people who haven’t used Gutenberg much yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those who build websites for clients have voiced concerns about how Gutenberg will affect their businesses, whether the brand new interface will drive users away from WordPress. Developers and product owners are eagerly awaiting more answers on what it means for existing plugins and themes in the ecosystem, as the project has yet to iron out some of the more technical details regarding extensibility and support for metaboxes. This naturally raises concerns about Gutenberg&#8217;s timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready, not vice versa,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We still have target dates to help us think about scope and plan for all the supporting documentation, translation, and marketing efforts, but we’re not going to release anything until Gutenberg is something the team working on it agrees is ready.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress users have been conditioned to anticipate releases on a regular schedule but the new approach to core development will allow for the next major release to wait until the targeted features are ready. Mullenweg confirmed in the comments of his post that Gutenberg will ship with a legacy interface to offer backwards compatibility for PHP metaboxes that have not yet updated to be JS-powered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some things like toolbar buttons will definitely need to be updated to work with Gutenberg, other things like Metaboxes there will be no problem to provide a legacy interface for a few releases,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;But I would say that plugin authors should start updating their plugins in late September if they want to benefit from Gutenberg’s launch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the most prevalent concerns that remains is React&#8217;s licensing issues, which came to a head after the Apache Software Foundation added Facebook’s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses for Apache PMC members. Facebook&#8217;s engineering directors considered re-licensing the project but <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/facebook-isnt-budging-on-reacts-bsd-patents-license\" target=\"_blank\">decided against it</a>, citing &#8220;meritless patent litigation&#8221; as the reason behind adopting the BSD + patents license. The WordPress project has yet to announce its stance on the decision.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We anticipated a decision on React around the Apache deadline (closer to now), will have more to announce about WP and Gutenberg’s approach here in the next few weeks,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>He also reiterated how invested he is in the WordPress project and ecosystem as a whole. His post elaborated on the many benefits he anticipates for plugin, theme, and core developers, agencies, users, and hosting companies. He challenged the WordPress community to see Gutenberg in the same light.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My life’s work is improving WordPress,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I firmly believe that Gutenberg is the direction that will provide the most benefit to the maximum number of people while being totally in line with core WordPress’s philosophies and commitment to user freedom. So keep giving us your feedback, and let’s push through the fear together.
