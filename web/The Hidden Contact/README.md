Author: [Pran-Ker](https://github.com/Pran-Ker)

## Description
SQL injection in contact form to reveil hidden access through a contact now form.



## Exploit

The challenge consists of a portfolio website, in which the challengers must use the "contact now" to fill in exact values (sort of like a secret login) to obtain the flag. The "contact now" stores the forms in a SQL Database. Using Sql injection, the challengers will obtain a list of filled forms, out of which one of them will be "admin". The admin message will be the message that will need to typed to obtain the flag.
